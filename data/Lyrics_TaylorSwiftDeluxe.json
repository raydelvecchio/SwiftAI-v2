And what what did you think the first time you heard it? Or how was the first time?\n\nIt was awesome. Uh, except for, I didn't know if I should, I should take it as a compliment or I should feel old?\nAh, ha ha ha\n\nI didn't know which one but the more, the more I hear it the more, I don't know if its true or not, but I start taking it as a compliment and not that I feel that I'm old, I don't know if that's true, but that's what I choose to think.\n\nWhy don't we find out. Taylor is a compliment, or uh, he's old?\n\nOh its definitely a compliment. Yeah. (Laughing)\n\nTim McGraw, meet Taylor Swift.\n\nNice-\n\nNice to meet you.\n\nNice to meet you, Taylor. How you doing?\n\nI'm doing great. How are you doing?\nSee Taylor Swift LiveGet tickets as low as $307\nI'm doing good. Congratulations on your record. It's doing great.\n\nThank you so much. I'm just so excited. Thank you for, uh, having good... music and everything. I swear I'm not a stalker (Laughing)\n\nWell-\n\nThe funny thing about this song is ya know, as a writer, some of the songs that you write like four hours, you'll do them writing a song and it'll be good and everything but I wrote this one in literally 15 minutes. And ya know, I really didn't think anything about calling in Tim McGraw so I kinda shelved it for like three months and never even thought that it was going to be a single. But, um, my label heard it and was like, \"we're putting that out.\"(Laughing)\n\nWell, I'm glad ya did, 'cause, um, it's doing well for ya.\n\nSo I-, so I understand that you two guys have not talked.\n\nNo.\n\nYou haven't met.\n\nNo.\nNo, we've never talked or met or anything.\n\nI sent her a message one time. I think with Entertainment Weekly\nOr something like that. Oh, I don't remember what show it was. I was doing an interview and they were going to interview Taylor the next day. So, I sent her a little message, so, I don't know if she got it or not.\n\nOh my God. They never gave that to me.\n\nThey didn't? Okay, well, there ya go. I did. (Laughing)\n\nSo I-I.\n\nWe've just officially never never talked or messaged or anything.\n\nNot at all.\n\nSo I thought, I think it's pretty brave to put out a song called Tim McGraw without maybe talking to Tim McGraw. Did you mind?\n\nIt was definitely kind of a chance. Ya know, I didn't say anything bad in the song so I was kinda thinking, ya know, he wouldn't take it too bad.\n\nWell, thank you for that. Thank you for not saying anything bad\nI'm sure there's plenty that could've been said. Tell me-\n\nCould you tell Faith that I said hello?\n\nI sure will. I sure will. And she loves the song too by the way.\n\nOh my gosh, she's awesome.\n\nI agree.\n\nThis, this...Tell me about writing a song. Um, did this, did this really happen?\n\nWell, yeah. I mean, I never really kinda went into this writing\nSession on I'm gonna write a song called Tim McGraw\nUm, yeah. because, that would just be weird. But um... (Laughing).\nI actually this this is kinda strange, but I actually came up with the\nmelody and ideas for this song in math class in my freshman year\nof high school.\n\nNow I feel old.\n\nAnd um, I was sitting there and was kind of started singing it to myself. And I was going through a period where I was dating this guy that was going off to college and I knew we were gonna break up. So I started to think about all the things that I knew would remind him of me. And it's kinda like a given one of all my friends ya know? That my favorite songs are Tim McGraw songs. They just are.\n\nAww, thank you.\n\nAnd uh, you know so I kinda just thought about that first. And so it pointed to the song and just sat down at that piano. And wrote it with this co-writer who was kinda wondering if I was crazy or not but it turned out alright. And ya know, the funny thing is that I shelved this song for like three months and never never even played it for anybody, never even demoed it. And uh, then one time I was just goofing around and played it for my record label president and he goes, \"Well, that's your first single.\" (Laughing)\n\nAnd I'm like, well.\n\nWell, you can write songs about me anytime, Taylor (Laughing)\n\nThat's awesome. There's a part two coming out next month.\n\nAlright, great (Laughing)\n\nWell, congratulations 'cause it's your first single. First top ten hit and thats pretty exciting. And I know you're off to the races here.\nYou're just doing great and, uh, congratulations, very exciting for you!\n\nAwesome, its been so exciting, Tim, when are you gonna start like bringing out opening acts again?\n\nUm, I don't know. I don't know. We'll have to look into that. (Laughing)\n\nWell, I'll, I have someone who I think will be really perfect for it.\n\nYa do? What would-\n\nYeah.\n\nWhat would their name be?\n\nUh, um, I think Taylor something.\n\nSomething like that, yeah\n\nBut.\n\nWell, I'll, I'll be more than happy to have you out with me.\n\nJust consider it.\n\nAh, well that's very good! You're pretty fearless, Taylor Swift. I'll tell ya that.\n\nRight she's, she's gonna be forward this time.\n\nI think so. Country Countdown USA is now a booking agency as well.\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nHey Taylor, I know you're on the road, thank ya so much for joining us.\n\nIt was awesome and thank you. It was good to meet you, Tim.\n\nYou too. Good talking to you. Bye bye now.\n\nBye.\n\nGood luck out there.\n\nThanks!Embed"
