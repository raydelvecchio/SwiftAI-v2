Tell me, how's your family?\nI haven't seen them in a while\nYou've been good, busier than ever\nWe small talk, work and the weather\nYour guard is up and I know why\n\nBecause the last time you saw me\nIs still burned in the back of your mind\nYou gave me roses and I left them there to die\nSo, this is me swallowing my pride\nStanding in front of you saying, \"I'm sorry for that night\"\nAnd I go back to December all the time\nIt turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you\nWishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine\nI go back to December, turn around and make it alright\nI go back to December all the time\n\nThese days, I haven't been sleeping\nStaying up, playing back myself leaving\nWhen your birthday passed and I didn't call\nAnd I think about summer, all the beautiful times\nI watched you laughing from the passenger side\nAnd realized I loved you in the fall\n\nAnd then the cold came, the dark days\nWhen fear crept into my mind\nYou gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye\n\nSo, this is me swallowing my pride\nStanding in front of you, saying, \"I'm sorry for that night\"\nAnd I go back to December all the time\nIt turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you\nWishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine\nI go back to December, turn around and change my own mind\nI go back to December all the time\nSee Taylor Swift LiveGet tickets as low as $307You might also like\nI miss your tan skin, your sweet smile\nSo good to me, so right\nAnd how you held me in your arms that September night\nThe first time you ever saw me cry\nMaybe this is wishful thinking\nProbably mindless dreaming\nBut if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right\nI'd go back in time and change it, but I can't\nSo, if the chain is on your door, I understand\n\nBut this is me swallowing my pride\nStanding in front of you, saying, \"I'm sorry for that night\"\nAnd I go back to December\nIt turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you\nWishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine\nI go back to December, turn around and make it alright\nI go back to December, turn around and change my own mind\nI go back to December all the time\n\nAll the time81Embed"

Yeah\nI don't know what to say since the twist of fate\nWhen it all broke down\nAnd the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now\n\nNext chapter\n\nHow'd we end up this way?\nSee me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy\nAnd you're doing your best to avoid me\nI'm starting to think one day, I'll tell the story of us\nHow I was losing my mind when I saw you here\nBut you held your pride like you should've held me\n\nOh, I'm scared to see the ending\nWhy are we pretending this is nothing?\nI'd tell you I miss you, but I don't know how\nI've never heard silence quite this loud\nSee Taylor Swift LiveGet tickets as low as $307You might also like\nNow, I'm standing alone in a crowded room\nAnd we're not speaking\nAnd I'm dying to know\nIs it killing you like it's killing me?

Promise me this\nThat you'll stand by me forever\nBut if, God forbid, fate should step in\nAnd force us into a goodbye\nIf you have children some day\nWhen they point to the pictures\nPlease tell 'em my name\nTell 'em how the crowds went wild\nTell 'em how I hope they shine\nLong live the walls we crashed through\nI had the time of my life with you\n\nLong, long live the walls we crashed through\nHow the kingdom lights shined just for me and you\nAnd I was screaming, \"Long live all the magic we made\"\nAnd bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid\nSinging, \"Long live all the mountains we moved\"\nI had the time of my life fighting dragons with you\nAnd long, long live that look on your face\nAnd bring on all the pretenders\nOne day, we will be remembered35Embed"

Tell me, how's your family?\nI haven't seen them in a while\nYou've been good, busier than ever\nWe small talk, work and the weather\nYour guard is up and I know why\n\nBecause the last time\nYou saw me is still burned in the back of your mind\nYou gave me roses and I left them there to die\nSo this is me swallowing my pride\nStanding in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night\nAnd I go back to December all the time\nIt turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you\nWishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine\nI go back to December, turn around and make it alright\nI go back to December all the time\n\nThese days, I haven't been sleeping\nStaying up playing back myself leaving\nWhen your birthday passed and I didn't call\nThen I think about summer, all the beautiful times\nI watched you laughing from the passenger side\nAnd realized I loved you in the fall\n\nAnd then the cold came\nThe dark days when fear crept into my mind\nYou gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye\n\nSo this is me swallowing my pride\nStanding in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night\nAnd I go back to December all the time\nIt turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you\nWishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine\nI go back to December, turn around and change my own mind\nI go back to December all the time\nSee Taylor Swift LiveGet tickets as low as $307You might also like\nI miss your tan skin, your sweet smile\nSo good to me, so right\nAnd how you held me in your arms that September night\nThe first time you ever saw me cry\nMaybe this is wishful thinking\nProbably mindless dreaming\nBut if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right\nI'd go back in time and change it, but I can't\nSo if the chain is on your door, I understand\n\nBut this is me swallowing my pride\nStanding in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night\nAnd I go back to December\nIt turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you\nWishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine\nI go back to December, turn around and make it alright\nI go back to December, turn around and change my own mind\nI go back to December all the time\n\nAll the timeEmbed"

    "lyrics": "Speak Now  LyricsPrologue\n'Speak now or forever hold your peace,' the words said by preachers at the end of wedding ceremonies all over the world, right before the vows. It's a last chance for protest, a moment that makes everyone's heart race, and a moment I've always been strangely fascinated by. So many fantasize about bursting into a church, saying what they'd kept inside for years like in the movies. In real life, it rarely happens.\nReal life is a funny thing, you know. In real life, saying the right thing at the right moment is beyond crucial. So crucial, in fact, the most of us start to hesitate, for fear of saying the wrong thing at the wrong time. But lately what I've begun to fear more than that is letting the moment pass without saying anything.\nI think most of us fear reaching the end of our life, and looking back regretting the moments we didn't speak up. When we didn't say 'I love you.' When we should've said 'I'm sorry.' When we didn't stand up for ourselves or someone who needed help.\nThese songs are made up of words I didn\u2019t say when the moment was right in front of me. These songs are open letters. Each is written with a specific person in mind, telling them what I meant to tell them in person. To the beautiful boy whose heart I broke in December. To my first love who I never thought would be my first heartbreak. To my band. To a mean man I used to be afraid of. To someone who made my world very dark for a while. To a girl who stole something of mine. To someone I forgive for what he said in front of the whole world.\nWords can break someone into a million pieces, but they can also put them back together. I hope you use yours for good, because the only words you\u2019ll regret more than the ones left unsaid are the ones you use to intentionally hurt someone.\nWhat you say might be too much for some people. Maybe it will come out all wrong and you\u2019ll stutter and you\u2019ll walk away embarrassed, wincing as you play it all back in your head. But I think the words you stop yourself from saying are the ones that will haunt you the longest.\nSo say it to them. Or say it to yourself in the mirror. Say it in a letter you\u2019ll never send or in a book millions might read someday. I think you deserve to look back on your life without a chorus of resounding voices saying \u2018I could\u2019ve, but it\u2019s too late now.\u2019\nThere is a time for silence. There is a time waiting your turn. But if you know how you feel, and you so clearly know what you need to say, you\u2019ll know it.\nI don't think you should wait. I think you should speak now.\nLove, Taylor\nPS: To all the boys who inspired this album, you should've known.\n1. Mine\nHidden message: Toby\n2. Sparks Fly\nHidden message: Portland, Oregon\n3.
