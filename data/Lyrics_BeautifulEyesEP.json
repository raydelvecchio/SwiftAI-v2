Lyrics\nWish I had concentrated\nThey said love was complicated\nBut it's something I just fell into\nAnd it was overrated\nBut just look what I've created\nI came out alive but I'm black and blue\n\nBefore you ask me if I\u2019m alright\nThink about what I had to do, yeah\nWake up and smell the breakup\nFix my heart, put on my makeup\nAnother mess I didn't plan\nAnd I'll bet you thought you'd beat me\nWish you could only see\nI got an \"I heart question mark\"\nWritten on the back of my hand\n\nI'd be fine if you just walked by\nBut you had to talk about why\nYou were wrong and I was right\nBut I can't believe you made me\nSit at home, cry like a baby\nWait right by the phone every night\n\nAnd now you ask about you and I\nThere's no you and I\nRemember what you put me through, I had to\n\nWake up and smell the breakup\nFix my heart, put on my makeup\nAnother mess I didn't plan\nAnd I'll bet you thought you'd beat me\nWish you could only see\nI got an \"I heart question mark\"\nWritten on the back of my hand\nSee Taylor Swift LiveGet tickets as low as $307You might also like\nAnd when you're home all alone at night\nYou'll still wonder why\nYou took everything I had, oh, baby\nI haven't thought about you and I\nThere's no you and I\nAnd I know someday you will\n\nWake up and smell the breakup\nRealize that we won't make up\nIt didn't go the way you planned\nAnd you'll know you didn't beat me\nWhen you look down and see\nI got an \"I heart question mark\"\nWritten on the back of my hand\n\nWritten on the back of my hand\nAn \"I heart question mark,\" yeah\nWritten on the back of my hand3Embed"
