Are we out of the woods yet?\nAre we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?\nAre we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?\nAre we in the clear yet, in the clear yet?

Are we out of the woods yet?\nAre we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?\nAre we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?\nAre we in the clear yet, in the clear yet?

Now I'm just making weird sounds\nHope you like it!6Embed"

It's so cool, I love these guitar sounds.\"\nAnd he played it for me and immediately I could hear this finished song in my head, and I just said \"Please, please let me have that. Let me play with it, like send it to me\"\nAnd so he sent it to me and I was on tour and this was me playing the track on my laptop recording me singing the vocal into my phone and it ended up being a song called \"I Wish You Would\", because Jack wrote back and said \"I love that\"\nSo this is another way of writing, it's writing to track:\nOkay so this is an idea called \"I Wish You Would\". It's kind of about this guy who's like, he's driving down the street at the middle of the night and he passes his ex-girlfriend's house and it's like, he thinks she hate him, but she's still in love with him, very dramatic. This track is sick, hope you like this\nIt's 2 am, in your car\nWindows down, past my street the memories start\nIt's in the past\nYou drive straight ahead\nYou thinking that I hate you now\n'Cause you still don't know what I never said\nI wish you would come back\nWish I never hung up the phone like I did\nI wish you knew that\nI'd never forget you as long as I live, and I\nWish you were right here, right now, it's all good\nI wish you would\nDo you like it!?See Taylor Swift LiveGet tickets as low as $307You might also like6Embed"

Hey, hey!\nGonna go down in flames\nYou can tell me when it's over\u2014\nThis is like a, like an early 2000s Nelly track\nLong list of ex-love\u2014\nGot a long list of ex-lovers, they'll tell you I'm insane\nBut I've got a blank space, baby\nI'll write your name\nI've got a blank space, baby\nI'll write your name\"\nThat's awesome! I love it\nOh my god, everyone's gonna kill you\nYeah!See Taylor Swift LiveGet tickets as low as $307You might also like14Embed"
