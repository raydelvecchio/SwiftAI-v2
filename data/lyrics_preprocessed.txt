Walking through a crowd the village is aglow
Kaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats
Everybody here wanted something more
Searching for a sound we hadnt heard before
And it said

Welcome to New York its been waiting for you
Welcome to New York welcome to New York
Welcome to New York its been waiting for you
Welcome to New York welcome to New York
Its a new soundtrack I could dance to this beat beat forevermore
The lights are so bright but they never blind me me
Welcome to New York its been waiting for you
Welcome to New York welcome to New York
When we first dropped our bags on apartment floors
Took our broken hearts put them in a drawer
Everybody here was someone else before
And you can want who you want
Boys and boys and girls and girls

Welcome to New York its been waiting for you
Welcome to New York welcome to New York
Welcome to New York its been waiting for you
Welcome to New York welcome to New York
Its a new soundtrack I could dance to this beat beat forevermore

Like any real love its ever-changing
Like any true love it drives you crazy
But you know you wouldnt change anything anything anything

Welcome to New York its been waiting for you

Looking at it now
It all seems so simple
We were lying on your couch
I remember
You took a Polaroid of us
Then discovered Then discovered
The rest of the world was black and white
But we were in screaming color
And I remember thinking
Are we out of the woods yet Are we out of the woods yet

Looking at it now
Last December Last December
We were built to fall apart
Then fall back together Back together
Ooh your necklace hanging from my neck
The night we couldnt quite forget
When we decided we decided
To move the furniture so we could dance
Baby like we stood a chance
Two paper airplanes flying flying flying
And I remember thinking

Are we out of the woods yet Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet Are we out of the woods
Are we in the clear yet Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet in the clear yet Good
Are we out of the woods yet Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet Oh Are we out of the woods
Are we in the clear yet Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet in the clear yet Good
Are we out of the woods
Remember when you hit the brakes too soon
Twenty stitches in the hospital room
When you started crying baby I did too
But when the sun came up I was looking at you
Remember when we couldnt take the heat
I walked out I said Im setting you free
But the monsters turned out to be just trees
When the sun came up you were looking at me
You were looking at me ooh
You were looking at me
Are we out of the woods yet Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet Are we out of the woods
I remember
Are we in the clear yet Are we in the clear yet

And his voice is a familiar sound

Clear blue water
High tide came and brought you in
And I could go on and on on and on and I will
Skies grew darker
Currents swept you out again
And you were just gone and gone gone and gone

In silent screams and wildest dreams
I never dreamed of this
This love is good this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead oh-oh oh
These hands had to let it go free and
This love came back to me oh-oh oh
Oh-oh oh-oh oh

Tossing turning
Struggled through the night with someone new
Baby I could go on and on on and on
Lantern burning
Flickered in my mind only you
But you were still gone gone gone

Been losing grip on sinking ships
You showed up just in time

This love is good this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead oh-oh oh
These hands had to let it go free and
This love came back to me oh-oh oh
This love left a permanent mark
This love is glowing in the dark oh-oh oh

You stand with your hand on my waistline
Its a scene and were out here in plain sight
I can hear them whisper as we pass by
Its a bad sign bad sign
Something happens when everybody finds out
See the vultures circling dark clouds
Loves a fragile little flame it could burn out
It could burn out
Cause they got the cages they got the boxes and guns
They are the hunters we are the foxes and we run

Baby I know places we wont be found
And theyll be chasing their tails trying to track us down
Cause I I know places we can hide
I know places I know places

Lights flash and well run for the fences
Let them say what they want we wont hear it
Loose lips sink ships all the damn time
Not this time

Just grab my hand and dont ever drop it my love
They are the hunters we are the foxes and we run

Baby I know places we wont be found
And theyll be chasing their tails trying to track us down
Cause I I know places we can hide
I know places
They are the hunters we are the foxes and we run
Just grab my hand and dont ever drop it my love

Baby I know places we wont be found
And theyll be chasing their tails trying to track us down
Cause I I know places we can hide
I know places

They take their shots but were bulletproof I know places
And you know for me its always you I know places
In the dead of night your eyes so green I know places
And I know for you its always me I know places
I I I I I I I I-I
I I I I I I I I-I
The drought was the very worst Oh-oh oh-oh
When the flowers that wed grown together died of thirst
It was months and months of back and forth Oh-oh oh-oh
Youre still all over me
Like a wine-stained dress I cant wear anymore

Hung my head as I lost the war
And the sky turned black like a perfect storm
Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning thats when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you I think I am finally clean
Oh oh oh oh

There was nothing left to do Oh-oh oh-oh
When the butterflies turned to
Dust that covered my whole room
So I punched a hole in the roof Oh-oh oh-oh
Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you

The water filled my lungs I screamed so loud
But no one heard a thing

Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning thats when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you I think I am finally clean
Oh oh oh oh

I think I am finally clean
Oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh-oh
Said I think I am finally clean
Oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh-oh
Ten months sober I must admit
Just because youre clean dont mean you dont miss it
Ten months older I wont give in
Now that Im clean Im never gonna risk it

The drought was the very worst Oh-oh oh-oh
When the flowers that wed grown together died of thirst
Oh

The rain came pouring down
When I was drowning thats when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you I think I am finally clean
Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning thats when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you I think I am finally clean

Oh oh
Finally clean
Think Im finally clean
Oh oh
Oh-oh oh-oh
Oh oh oh
Flashing lights and we
Took a wrong turn and we
Fell down a rabbit hole
You held on tight to me
Cause nothings as it seems
And spinning out of control
Didnt they tell us Dont rush into things
Didnt you flash your green eyes at me
Havent you heard what becomes of curious minds
Ooh didnt it all seem new and exciting
I felt your arms twistin around me
I should have slept with one eye open at night
We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever Eh eh
We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And life was never worse but never better Eh eh

Eh eh eh eh eh
In Wonderland
Eh eh eh eh eh
In Wonderland
Eh eh eh eh eh
In Wonderland
Eh eh eh eh eh
In Wonderland

So we went on our way
Too in love to think straight
All alone or so it seemed
But there were strangers watching
And whispers turned to talking
And talking turned to screams oh
Didnt they tell us Dont rush into things
Didnt you flash your green eyes at me
Didnt you calm my fears with a Cheshire cat smile
Ooh didnt it all seem new and exciting
I felt your arms twistin around me
Its all fun and games til somebody loses their mind
But darlin

We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever Eh eh
We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And life was never worse but never better Eh eh

Eh eh eh eh eh
In Wonderland
Eh eh eh eh eh
In Wonderland
Eh eh eh eh eh
In Wonderland
Eh eh eh eh eh
Whoa in Wonderland
I reached for you but you were gone
I knew I had to go back home
You searched the world for something else
To make you feel like what we had
And in the end in Wonderland
We both went mad
Oh

We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever
Last forever Eh eh
We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it Got lost in it
And life was never worse but never better
Never better Eh eh
Eh eh eh eh eh
We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
Eh eh eh eh eh
And we pretended it could last forever In Wonderland
Eh eh eh eh eh
We found Wonderland
You and I got lost in it
Eh eh eh eh eh
And life was never worse but never better
One look dark room
Meant just for you
Time moved too fast you play it back
Buttons on a coat lighthearted joke
No proof not much but you saw enough
Small talk he drives
Coffee at midnight
The light reflects the chain on your neck
He says Look up
And your shoulders brush
No proof one touch but you felt enough
You can hear it in the silence Silence silence Silence you
You can feel it on the way home Way home way home Way home you
You can see it with the lights out Lights out lights out Lights out
You are in love true love
You are in love

Morning his place
Burnt toast Sunday
You keep his shirt he keeps his word
And for once you let go
Of your fears and your ghosts
One step not much but it said enough
You kiss on sidewalks
You fight and you talk
One night he wakes
Strange look on his face
Pauses then says Youre my best friend
And you knew what it was he is in love

You can hear it in the silence Silence silence Silence you
You can feel it on the way home Way home way home Way home you
You can see it with the lights out Lights out lights out Lights out
You are in love true love
And so it goes
You two are dancing in a snow globe round and round
And he keeps a picture of you in his office downtown
And you understand now
Why they lost their minds and fought the wars
And why Ive spent my whole life trying to put it into words

Cause you can hear it in the silence
You can feel it on the way home
You can see it with the lights out
You are in love true love
You are in love

You can hear it in the silence Silence silence Silence you
You can feel it on the way home Way home way home Way home you
You can see it with the lights out Lights out lights out Lights out
You are in love true love
You are in love Ah
You can hear it in the silence Silence silence Silence you Ah
You can feel it on the way home Way home way home Way home you Ah
You can see it with the lights out Lights out lights out Lights out
You are in love true love
Were all bored were all so tired of everything
We wait for trains that just arent coming
We show off our different scarlet letters
Trust me mine is better
Were so young but were on the road to ruin
We play dumb but we know exactly what were doing
We cry tears of mascara in the bathroom
Honey life is just a classroom
Ah ah ah ah ah ah
Cause baby I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream
Baby were the new romantics
Come on come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby were the new romantics
The best people in life are free

Were all here the lights and noise are blinding
We hang back its all in the timing
Its poker he cant see it in my face
But Im about to play my Ace Ahh
We need love but all we want is danger
We team up then switch sides like a record changer
The rumors are terrible and cruel
But honey most of them are true
Ah ah ah ah ah ah

Cause baby I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle Every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream
Baby were the new romantics
Come on come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing Yeah
To get knocked off our feet Hey
Baby were the new romantics
The best people in life are free

Heartbreak is the national anthem Ah ah ah ah ah
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing Ah ah ah ah ah
To get knocked off our feet
Baby were the new romantics Ah ah ah ah ah
How long does it take where do you write what are the circumstances do you start with music do you start with lyrics and my answer is always that it happens differently every time and thats why Im still so in love with song writing
So what Ive done here is shown you three different examples of the beginning stages of these songs and how they each started different ways
So Ill explain them to you and maybe that will help you understand kind of how I put songs together
I sent this voice memo to Ryan Tedder because Id always wanted to work with him and finally we scheduled some studio time
So I always wanna be prepared
I wanted to send him the idea that I was working on before we went into the studio just in case he wrote back and said I cant stand that I wanna work on something else think of something else
So I just sat down with the piano put my phone on top of the piano and just kind of explained to him where I wanted to go with the song how I saw the melody sitting in and we ended up recording the song the next day and it ended up being on the record called I Know Places
So this was the voice memo I sent to him the night before we ended up finishing the song
Okay so this is kind of this rough idea thing
Uh-uh-uh-oh oh-oh-oh-i
Oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh-i
Oh-oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh-i-i-i
Na na na na waiting at the back door
Theyre around and the vultures come around
And you know that they wont they wont us
Say what they want bout say what they want bout us
And you come and sing and listen
I would not think about it but Im not done
Every know that a thing or two about it thing or two about it I
Cause they got the cages they got the boxes
And guns
They are the hunters we are the foxes
And we run
Baby I know some places we wont be found
And theyll be chasing their tails trying to track us down
Cause I I know places we can hide
I know places I know places
Uh-uh-uh-i uh-uh-uh-i oh-oh-i uh-uh-uh-i know places
I dont know but thats basically just like a dark really dark lyric like bridge thing and its about like everybodys like trying to get into and ruin a love or whatever and its like you just whatever you know and the chorus would just go to that major and just be like ooh chorus
So I hope you like it it wouldnt be a piano thing
It would be like 
Like very like beat Now Im just making weird sounds
This is a song I did with Jack Antonoff and Jack is one of my friends and so were hanging out and he pulled out his phone and goes I made this amazing track the other day Its so cool I love these guitar sounds
And he played it for me and immediately I could hear this finished song in my head and I just said Please please let me have that Let me play with it like send it to me
And so he sent it to me and I was on tour and this was me playing the track on my laptop recording me singing the vocal into my phone and it ended up being a song called I Wish You Would because Jack wrote back and said I love that
So this is another way of writing its writing to track
Okay so this is an idea called I Wish You Would Its kind of about this guy whos like hes driving down the street at the middle of the night and he passes his ex-girlfriends house and its like he thinks she hate him but shes still in love with him very dramatic This track is sick hope you like this
Its 2 am in your car
Windows down past my street the memories start
Its in the past
You drive straight ahead
You thinking that I hate you now
Cause you still dont know what I never said
I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that
Id never forget you as long as I live and I
Wish you were right here right now its all good
I wish you would
Um so I brought in this idea called Blank Space and this was me playing it for Max and Johan for the first time and theyre shouting out these proju— production ideas like you know the Oh at the beginning of the chorus um and that ended up in the song
So this is the very beginning stages of the song on the album called Blank Space
Nice to meet you where you been
I could show you incredible things
Diamonds seasides all these gems
 this song that 
Like oh my God listen in
Listen in I do too
 honest 
We can all sing this and cry
All youre thinking all this time
Oh my God listen me
Just forget what youve heard about me
Dont believe what you hear about me hear about me
Cause its gonna be forever or gonna go—
Yeah Hey hey
Gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when its over—
This is like a like an early 2000s Nelly track
Long list of ex-love—
Got a long list of ex-lovers theyll tell you Im insane
But Ive got a blank space baby
Ill write your name
Ive got a blank space baby
Ill write your name
Thats awesome I love it
Oh my god everyones gonna kill you
Your beautiful eyes
Stare right into mine
And sometimes I think of you late at night
I dont know why

I wanna be somewhere where you are
I wanna be where

Youre here your eyes are lookin into mine
So baby make me fly
My heart has never felt this way before
Im looking through your—
Im looking through your eyes
I wake up Im alive
In only a little while Ill cry
Cause youre my lullaby
So baby come hold me tight cause I

I wanna be everything you need
I wanna be where

Youre here your eyes are lookin into mine
So baby make me fly
My heart has never felt this way before
Im looking through your—
Im looking through your eyes

Just as long as youre mine
Ill be your everything tonight
Let me love you kiss you
Oh baby let me miss you
Let me see your dream about dream about
Dream about your eyes

Ah ah
Its strange to think the songs we used to sing
The smiles the flowers everything is gone
Yesterday I found out about you
Even now just lookin at you feels wrong

You say that youd take it all back
Given one chance
It was a moment of weakness
And you said yes
You shouldve said no you shouldve gone home
You shouldve thought twice fore you let it all go
You shouldve known that word
Bout what you did with her’d get back to me Get back to me
And I shouldve been there in the back of your mind
I shouldnt be asking myself why
You shouldnt be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You shouldve said no
Baby and you might still have me

You can see that Ive been cryin
And baby you know all the right things to say
But do you honestly expect me to believe
We could ever be the same

You say that the past is the past
You need one chance
It was a moment of weakness
And you said yes

You shouldve said no you shouldve gone home
You shouldve thought twice fore you let it all go
You shouldve known that word
Bout what you did with her’d get back to me Get back to me
And I shouldve been there in the back of your mind
I shouldnt be asking myself why
You shouldnt be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You shouldve said no
Baby and you might still have me
Oh oh
I cant resist
Before you go tell me this
Was it worth it
Was she worth this
No no
No no no no

You shouldve said no you shouldve gone home
You shouldve thought twice fore you let it all go
You shouldve known that word
Bout what you did with her’d get back to me Get back to me
And I shouldve been there in the back of your mind
I shouldnt be asking myself why
You shouldnt be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You shouldve said no
Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he wont see
That I want and Im needing
Everything that we should be

Ill bet shes beautiful
That girl he talks about
And shes got everything that I have to live without
Drew talks to me
I laugh cause its just so funny
That I cant even see
Anyone when hes with me

He says hes so in love
Hes finally got it right
I wonder if he knows hes all I think about at night

Hes the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
Hes the song in the car I keep singing
Dont know why I do

Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I cant breathe
And there he goes so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be

Shed better hold him tight
Give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know shes lucky cause
Hes the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
Hes the song in the car I keep singing
Dont know why I do

So I drive home alone
As I turn off the light
Ill put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight

Cause hes the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who’s got enough for me to break my heart
Hes the song in the car I keep singing
Dont know why I do
Hes the time taken up but theres never enough
And hes all that I need to fall into

Drew looks at me
State the obvious I didnt get my perfect fantasy
I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
So go and tell your friends that Im obsessive and crazy
Thats fine you wont mind if I say
By the way

I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
Youre a redneck heartbreak whos really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as Im concerned youre just another picture to burn
Therеs no time for tears
Im just sitting herе planning my revenge
Theres nothing stopping me
From going out with all of your best friends
And if you come around saying sorry to me
My daddys gonna show you how sorry youll be

Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
Youre a redneck heartbreak whos really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as Im concerned youre just another picture to burn

And if youre missing me youd better keep it to yourself
Cause coming back around here would be bad for your health

Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
Youre a redneck heartbreak whos really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
In case you havent heard
I really really hate that
Stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
Youre a redneck heartbreak whos really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as Im concerned youre just another picture to burn
Burn burn burn baby burn
Youre just another picture to burn
Friday night beneath the stars
In a field behind your yard
You and I are painting pictures in the sky
And sometimes we dont say a thing
Just listen to the crickets sing
Everything I need is right here by my side

And I know everything about you
I dont wanna live without you
Im only up when youre not down
Dont wanna fly if youre still on the ground
Its like no matter what I do
Well you drive me crazy half the time
The other half Im only tryin to
Let you know that what I feel is true
And Im only me when Im with you

Just a small-town boy and girl
Livin in a crazy world
Tryna figure out what is and isnt true
And I dont try to hide my tears
My secrets or my deepest fears
Through it all nobody gets me like you do

And you know everything about me
You say that you cant live without me

Im only up when youre not down
Dont wanna fly if youre still on the ground
Its like no matter what I do
Well you drive me crazy half the time
The other half Im only tryin to
Let you know that what I feel is true
And Im only me when Im with you
When Im with anybody else
Its so hard to be myself
And only you can tell

That Im only up when youre not down
Dont wanna fly if youre still on the ground
Its like no matter what I do
Well you drive me crazy half the time
The other half Im only tryin to
Let you know that what I feel is true
And Im only me
Who I wanna be
Well Im only me when Im with you

With you
Wish I had concentrated
They said love was complicated
But its something I just fell into
And it was overrated
But just look what Ive created
I came out alive but Im black and blue

Before you ask me if I’m alright
Think about what I had to do yeah
Wake up and smell the breakup
Fix my heart put on my makeup
Another mess I didnt plan
And Ill bet you thought youd beat me
Wish you could only see
I got an I heart question mark
Written on the back of my hand

Id be fine if you just walked by
But you had to talk about why
You were wrong and I was right
But I cant believe you made me
Sit at home cry like a baby
Wait right by the phone every night

And now you ask about you and I
Theres no you and I
Remember what you put me through I had to

Wake up and smell the breakup
Fix my heart put on my makeup
Another mess I didnt plan
And Ill bet you thought youd beat me
Wish you could only see
I got an I heart question mark
Written on the back of my hand
And when youre home all alone at night
Youll still wonder why
You took everything I had oh baby
I havent thought about you and I
Theres no you and I
And I know someday you will

Wake up and smell the breakup
Realize that we wont make up
It didnt go the way you planned
And youll know you didnt beat me
When you look down and see
I got an I heart question mark
Written on the back of my hand

Written on the back of my hand
An I heart question mark yeah
Im like the water when your ship rolled in that night
Rough on the surface but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an open-shut case
I never wouldve known from that look on your face
Lost in your current like a priceless wine

The more that you say the less I know
Wherever you stray I follow
Im begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans thats my man
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
Head on the pillow I could feel you sneakin in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And there was one prize Id cheat to win

The more that you say the less I know
Wherever you stray I follow
Im begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans thats my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
Im begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans thats my man

Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
They count me out time and time again
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
But I come back stronger than a 90s trend

Wait for the signal and Ill meet you after dark
Show me the places where the others gave you scars
Now this is an open-shut case
I guess I shouldve known from the look on your face
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art
The more that you say the less I know
Wherever you stray I follow
Im begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans thats my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
Im begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans thats my man
The more that you say the less I know
Wherever you stray I follow
Im begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans thats my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
Im begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans thats my man

Hey thats my man
Thats my man
Yeah thats my man
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art
Thats my man
Hey thats my man
Im begging for you to take my hand
You booked the night train for a reason
So you could sit there in this hurt
Bustling crowds or silent sleepers
Youre not sure which is worse

Because I dropped your hand while dancing
Left you out there standing
Crestfallen on the landing
Champagne problems
Your moms ring in your pocket
My picture in your wallet
Your heart was glass I dropped it
Champagne problems
You told your family for a reason
You couldnt keep it in
Your sister splashed out on the bottle
Now no ones celebrating

Dom Pérignon you brought it
No crowd of friends applauded
Your hometown skeptics called it
Champagne problems
You had a speech youre speechless
Love slipped beyond your reaches
And I couldnt give a reason
Champagne problems
Your Midas touch on the Chevy door
November flush and your flannel cure
This dorm was once a madhouse
I made a joke Well its made for me
How evergreen our group of friends
Dont think well say that word again
And soon theyll have the nerve to deck the halls
That we once walked through
One for the money two for the show
I never was ready so I watch you go
Sometimes you just dont know the answer
Til someones on their knees and asks you
She wouldve made such a lovely bride
What a shame shes fucked in the head they said
But youll find the real thing instead
Shell patch up your tapestry that I shred
And hold your hand while dancing
Never leave you standing
Crestfallen on the landing
With champagne problems
Your moms ring in your pocket
Her picture in your wallet
You wont remember all my
Champagne problems

You wont remember all my
Gleaming twinkling
Eyes like sinking ships on waters
So inviting I almost jump in

But I dont like a gold rush gold rush
I dont like anticipatin my face in a red flush
I dont like that anyone would die to feel your touch
Everybody wants you
Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you
Walk past quick brush
I dont like slow motion double vision in rose blush
I dont like that falling feels like flying til the bone crush
Everybody wants you
But I dont like a gold rush
What must it be like to grow up that beautiful
With your hair falling into place like dominoes
I see me padding across your wooden floors
With my Eagles t-shirt hanging from the door

At dinner parties I call you out on your contrarian shit
And the coastal town we wandered round had nеver seen a love as pure as it
And thеn it fades into the gray of my day-old tea
Cause it could never be

Cause I dont like a gold rush gold rush
I dont like anticipatin my face in a red flush
I dont like that anyone would die to feel your touch
Everybody wants you
Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you
Walk past quick brush
I dont like slow motion double vision in rose blush
I dont like that falling feels like flying til the bone crush
Everybody wants you
But I dont like a gold rush

What must it be like to grow up that beautiful
With your hair falling into place like dominoes
My mind turns your life into folklore
I cant dare to dream about you anymore
At dinner parties I wont call you out on your contrarian shit
And the coastal town we never found will never see a love as pure as it
Cause it fades into the gray of my day-old tea
Cause it will never be

Gleaming twinkling
Eyes like sinking ships on waters
If I wanted to know who you were hanging with
While I was gone I wouldve asked you
Its the kind of cold fogs up windshield glass
But I felt it when I passed you
Theres an ache in you put there by the ache in me
But if its all the same to you
Its the same to me

So we could call it even
You could call me babe for the weekend
​Tis the damn season write this down
Im stayin at my parents house
And the road not taken looks real good now
And it always leads to you and my hometown
I parkеd my car right between the Methodist
And thе school that used to be ours
The holidays linger like bad perfume
You can run but only so far
I escaped it too remember how you watched me leave
But if its okay with you its okay with me

We could call it even
You could call me babe for the weekend
​Tis the damn season write this down
Im stayin at my parents house
And the road not taken looks real good now
Time flies messy as the mud on your truck tires
Now Im missing your smile hear me out
We could just ride around
And the road not taken looks real good now
And it always leads to you and my hometown

Sleep in half the day just for old times sake
I wont ask you to wait if you dont ask me to stay
So Ill go back to LA and the so-called friends
Wholl write books about me if I ever make it
And wonder about the only soul
Who can tell which smiles Im fakin
And the heart I know Im breakin is my own
To leave the warmest bed Ive ever known
We could call it even
Even though Im leaving
And Ill be yours for the weekend
​Tis the damn season
We could call it even
You could call me babe for the weekend
​Tis the damn season write this down
Im stayin at my parents house
And the road not taken looks real good now
Time flies messy as the mud on your truck tires
Now Im missing your smile hear me out
We could just ride around
And the road not taken looks real good now
And it always leads to you and my hometown

I sit and watch you reading with your head low
I wake and watch you breathing with your eyes closed
I sit and watch you
I notice everything you do or dont do
Youre so much older and wiser and I

I wait by the door like Im just a kid
Use my best colors for your portrait
Lay the table with the fancy shit
And watch you tolerate it
If its all in my head tell me now
Tell me Ive got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it
I greet you with a battle heros welcome
I take your indiscretions all in good fun
I sit and listеn I polish plates until they gleam and glistеn
Youre so much older and wiser and I

I wait by the door like Im just a kid
Use my best colors for your portrait
Lay the table with the fancy shit
And watch you tolerate it
If its all in my head tell me now
Tell me Ive got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it

While you were out building other worlds where was I
Wheres that man whod throw blankets over my barbed wire
I made you my temple my mural my sky
Now Im begging for footnotes in the story of your life
Drawing hearts in the byline
Always taking up too much space or time
You assume Im fine but what would you do if I

Break free and leave us in ruins
Took this dagger in me and removed it
Gain the weight of you then lose it
Believe me I could do it
If its all in my head tell me now
Tell me Ive got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it
He did it
He did it

Estes a friend of mine
We meet up every Tuesday night for dinner and a glass of wine
Estes been losin sleep
Her husbands actin different and it smells like infidelity
She says That aint my Merlot on his mouth
That aint my jewelry on our joint account
No there aint no doubt
I think Im gonna call him out
She says I think he did it but I just cant prove it
I think he did it but I just cant prove it
I think he did it but I just cant prove it
No no body no crime
But I aint lettin up until the day I die

No no
I think he did it
No no
He did it

Este wasnt there Tuesday night at Olive Gardеn
At her job or anywhere
Hе reports his missing wife
And I noticed when I passed his house
His truck has got some brand new tires
And his mistress moved in
Sleeps in Estes bed and everything
No there aint no doubt
Somebodys gotta catch him out cause

I think he did it but I just cant prove it He did it
I think he did it but I just cant prove it He did it
I think he did it but I just cant prove it
No no body no crime
But I aint lettin up until the day I die
No no
I think he did it
No no
He did it

Good thing my daddy made me get a boating license when I was fifteen
And Ive cleaned enough houses to know how to cover up a scene
Good thing Estes sisters gonna swear she was with me
She was with me dude
Good thing his mistress took out a big life insurance policy

They think she did it but they just cant prove it
They think she did it but they just cant prove it
She thinks I did it but she just cant prove it

No no body no crime
I wasnt lettin up until the day he—
No no body no crime
I wasnt lettin up until the day he—
No no body no crime
Honey when Im above the trees
I see this for what it is
But now Im right down in it all the years Ive given
Is just shit were dividin up
Showed you all of my hiding spots
I was dancing when the music stopped
And in the disbelief I cant face reinvention
I havent met the new me yet

Therell be happiness after you
But there was happiness because of you
Both of these things can be true
There is happiness
Past the blood and bruise
Past the curses and cries
Beyond the terror in the nightfall
Haunted by the look in my eyes
That wouldve loved you for a lifetime
Leave it all behind
And there is happiness

Tell me when did your winning smile
Begin to look like a smirk
When did all our lessons start to look like weapons
Pointed at my deepest hurt
I hope shell be a beautiful fool
Who takes my spot next to you
No I didnt mean that
Sorry I cant see facts through all of my fury
You havent met the new me yet

Therell be happiness after me
But there was happiness because of me
Both of these things I believe
There is happiness
In our history across our great divide
There is a glorious sunrise
Dappled with the flickers of light
From the dress I wore at midnight leave it all behind
And there is happiness

I cant make it go away by making you a villain
I guess its the price I paid for seven years in Heaven
And I pulled your body into mine
Every goddamn night now I get fake niceties
No one teaches you what to do
When a good man hurts you
And you know you hurt him too

Honey when Im above the trees
I see it for what it is
But now my eyes leak acid rain on the pillow where you used to lay your head
After giving you the best I had
Tell me what to give after that
All you want from me now is the green light of forgiveness
You havent met the new me yet
And I think shell give you that
Therell be happiness after you
But there was happiness because of you too
Both of these things can be true
There is happiness

In our history across our great divide
There is a glorious sunrise
Dappled with the flickers of light
From the dress I wore at midnight leave it all behind
Oh leave it all behind
Leave it all behind
Hey Dorothea do you ever stop and think about me
When we were younger down in the park
Honey making a lark of the misery
You got shiny friends since you left town
A tiny screens the only place I see you now
And I got nothing but well wishes for ya

Ooh this place is the same as it ever was
Ooh but you wont like it that way
Its never too late to come back to my side
The stars in your eyes shined brighter in Tupelo
And if youre ever tired of bеing known for who you know
You know that youll always know me Dorothea Uh-uh
Dorothea Ah-ah

Ooh yourе a queen sellin dreams sellin makeup and magazines
Ooh from you Id buy anything

Hey Dorothea do you ever stop and think about me
When it was calmer skipping the prom just to piss off your mom and her pageant schemes
And damn Dorothea they all wanna be ya
But are you still the same soul I met under the bleachers Well

Ooh I guess Ill never know
Ooh and youll go on with the show

But its never too late to come back to my side
The stars in your eyes shined brighter in Tupelo
And if youre ever tired of being known for who you know
You know youll always know me Dorothea Uh-uh
Dorothea Ah-ah
Ooh ooh
Ooh-woo-ooh-ooh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh ooh
Ooh-woo-ooh-ooh-ooh ooh-ooh-ooh
Dorothea Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah
Break my soul in two looking for you
But youre right here
If I cant relate to you anymore
Then who am I related to
And if this is the long haul
Howd we get here so soon
Did I close my fist around something delicate
Did I shatter you

And Im sitting on a bench in Coney Island
Wondering where did my baby go
The fast times the bright lights the merry go
Sorry for not making you my centerfold
Over and over
Lost again with no surprises
Disappointments close your eyes
And it gets colder and colder
When the sun goes down

The question pounds my head
Whats a lifetime of achievement
If I pushed you to the edge
But you were too polite to leave me
And do you miss the rogue
Who coaxed you into paradise and left you there
Will you forgive my soul
When youre too wise to trust me and too old to care

Cause we were like the mall before the internet
It was the one place to be
The mischief the gift-wrapped suburban dreams
Sorry for not winning you an arcade ring

Over and over
Lost again with no surprises
Disappointments close your eyes
And it gets colder and colder
When the sun goes down
Were you waiting at our old spot
In the tree line
By the gold clock
Did I leave you hanging every single day
Were you standing in the hallway
With a big cake happy birthday
Did I paint your bluest skies the darkest grey
A universe away
And when I got into the accident
The sight that flashed before me was your face
But when I walked up to the podium I think that I forgot to say your name

Im on a bench in Coney Island
Wondering where did my baby go
The fast times the bright lights the merry go
Sorry for not making you my centerfold

Over and over
Lost again with no surprises
Disappointments close your eyes
And it gets colder and colder
When the sun goes down
When the sun goes down
The sight that flashed before me was your face
When the sun goes down
But I think that I forgot to say your name
Over and over
Sorry for not making you my making you my
Hows one to know
Id meet you where the spirit meets the bones
In a faith-forgotten land
In from the snow
Your touch brought forth an incandescent glow
Tarnished but so grand

And the old widow goes to the stone every day
But I dont I just sit here and wait
Grieving for the living
Oh goddamn
My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
Taking mine but its been promised to another
Oh I cant
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone your ivy grows
And now Im covered in you

I wish to know
The fatal flaw that makes you long to be
Magnificently cursed
Hes in the room
Your opal eyes are all I wish to see
He wants whats only yours

Oh goddamn
My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
Taking mine but its been promised to another
Oh I cant
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone your ivy grows
And now Im covered
Clover blooms in the fields
Spring breaks loose the time is near
What would he do if he found us out
Crescent moon coast is clear
Spring breaks loose but so does fear
Hes gonna burn this house to the ground
Hows one to know
Id live and die for moments that we stole
On begged and borrowed time
So tell me to run
Or dare to sit and watch what well become
And drink my husbands wine

Oh goddamn
My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
Taking mine but its been promised to another
Oh I cant
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone your ivy grows
And now Im covered in you
And Im covered in you

So yeah its a fire
Its a goddamn blaze in the dark
And you started it
You started it
So yeah its a war
Its the goddamn fight of my life
And you started it
You started it
Oh I cant
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone your ivy grows
And now Im covered
In you in you
Now Im covered in you
And the tennis court was covered up
With some tent-like thing
And you asked me to dance
But I said Dancin is a dangerous game

Oh I thought
This is gonna be one of those things
Now I know
Im never gonna love again
Ive got some tricks up my sleeve
Takes one to know one
Youre a cowboy like me

Never wanted love
Just a fancy car
Now Im waiting by the phone
Like Im sitting in an airport bar
You had some tricks up your sleeve
Takes one to know one
Youre a cowboy like me

Perched in the dark
Telling all the rich folks anything they wanna hear
Like it could be love
I could be the way forward
Only if they pay for it
Youre a bandit like me

Eyes full of stars
Hustling for the good life
Never thought Id meet you here
It could be love
We could be the way forward
And I know Ill pay for it
Youre a cowboy like me

Perched in the dark
Telling all the rich folks anything they wanna hear
Like it could be love
I could be the way forward
Only if they pay for it
Youre a bandit like me

Eyes full of stars
Hustling for the good life
Never thought Id meet you here
It could be love
We could be the way forward
And I know Ill pay for it

And the skeletons in both our closets
Plotted hard to fuck this up
And the old men that Ive swindled
Really did believe I was the one
And the ladies lunching have their stories about
When you passed through town
But that was all before I locked it down
Now you hang from my lips
Like the Gardens of Babylon
With your boots beneath my bed
Forever is the sweetest con

Ive had some tricks up my sleeve
Takes one to know one
Youre a cowboy like me

And Im never gonna love again
Im never gonna love again
Fatefully
I tried to pick my battles til the battle picked me
Misery
Like the war of words I shouted in my sleep
And you passed right by
I was in the alley surrounded on all sides
The knife cuts both ways
If the shoe fits walk in it til your high heels break

And I fell from the pedestal
Right down the rabbit hole
Long story short it was a bad time
Pushed from the precipice
Clung to the nearest lips
Long story short it was the wrong guy
Now Im all about you
Im all about you ah
Yeah yeah
Im all about you ah
Yeah yeah

Actually
I always felt I must look better in the rear view
Missing me
At the golden gates they once held the keys to
When I dropped my sword
I threw it in the bushes and knocked on your door
And we live in peace
But if someone comes at us this time Im ready

Cause I fell from the pedestal
Right down the rabbit hole
Long story short it was a bad time
Pushed from the precipice
Clung to the nearest lips
Long story short it was the wrong guy

Now Im all about you
Im all about you ah
Yeah yeah
Im all about you
No more keepin score
Now I just keep you warm Keep you warm
No more tug of war
Now I just know theres more Know theres more
No more keepin score
Now I just keep you warm Keep you warm
And my waves meet your shore
Ever and evermore

Past me
I wanna tell you not to get lost in these petty things
Your nemeses
Will defeat themselves before you get the chance to swing
And hes passing by
Rare as the glimmer of a comet in the sky
And he feels like home
If the shoe fits walk in it everywhere you go

And I fell from the pedestal
Right down the rabbit hole
Long story short it was a bad time
Pushed from the precipice
Climbed right back up the cliff
Long story short I survived
Now Im all about you
And now Im all about you ah
And now Im all about you
And now Im all about you ah
Yeah yeah
Im all about you
And now Yeah yeah
Im all about you

Long story short it was a bad time
Never be so kind
You forget to be clever
Never be so clever
You forget to be kind

And if I didnt know better
Id think you were talking to me now
If I didnt know better
Id think you were still around
What died didnt stay dead
What died didnt stay dead
Youre alive youre alive in my head
What died didnt stay dead
What died didnt stay dead
Youre alive so alive

Never be so politе
You forget your power
Nevеr wield such power
You forget to be polite

And if I didnt know better
Id think you were listening to me now
If I didnt know better
Id think you were still around

What died didnt stay dead
What died didnt stay dead
Youre alive youre alive in my head
What died didnt stay dead
What died didnt stay dead
Youre alive so alive
The autumn chill that wakes me up
You loved the amber skies so much
Long limbs and frozen swims
Youd always go past where our feet could touch
And I complained the whole way there
The car ride back and up the stairs
I shouldve asked you questions
I shouldve asked you how to be
Asked you to write it down for me
Shouldve kept every grocery store receipt
Cause every scrap of you would be taken from me
Watched as you signed your name Marjorie
All your closets of backlogged dreams
And how you left them all to me

What died didnt stay dead
What died didnt stay dead
Youre alive youre alive in my head
What died didnt stay dead
What died didnt stay dead
Youre alive so alive

And if I didnt know better
Id think you were singing to me now
If I didnt know better
Id think you were still around
I know better
But I still feel you all around
I know better
Its been a long time
And seeing the shape of your name
Still spells out pain
It wasnt right
The way it all went down
Looks like you know that now

Yes I got your letter
Yes Im doing better
It cut deep to know ya right to the bone
Yes I got your letter
Yes Im doing better
I know that its over I dont need your
Closure your closure
Dont treat me like
Some situation that needs to be handled
Im fine with my spite
And my tears and my beers and my candles
I can feel you smoothing me over

Yes I got your letter
Yes Im doing bettеr
It cut deep to know ya right to the bone
Yes I got your lеtter
Yes Im doing better
I know that its over I dont need your
Closure your closure
Your closure your closure

I know Im just a wrinkle in your new life
Staying friends would iron it out so nice
Guilty guilty reaching out across the sea
That you put between you and me
But its fake and its oh so unnecessary

Yes I got your letter
Yes Im doing better
It cut deep to know ya right to the bone
Yes I got your letter
Yes Im doing better
I know that its over I dont need your
Closure closure your closure
Gray November
Ive been down since July
Motion capture
Put me in a bad light
I replay my footsteps on each stepping stone
Trying to find the one where I went wrong
Writing letters
Addressed to the fire

And I was catching my breath
Staring out an open window
Catching my death
And I couldnt be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar
That this pain would be for
Evermore
Hey December
Guess Im feeling unmoored
Cant remember
What I used to fight for
I rewind thе tape but all it does is pause
On thе very moment all was lost
Sending signals
To be double-crossed

And I was catching my breath
Barefoot in the wildest winter
Catching my death
And I couldnt be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar
That this pain would be for
Evermore
Evermore
Cant not think of all the cost
And the things that will be lost
Oh can we just get a pause
To be certain well be tall again
Whether weather be the frost
Or the violence of the dog days
Im on waves out being tossed
Is there a line that I could just go cross
And when I was shipwrecked Cant think of all the cost
I thought of you All the things that will be lost now
In the cracks of light Can we just get a pause
I dreamed of you To be certain well be tall again if you think of all the costs
It was real enough Whether weather be the frost
To get me through Or the violence of the dog days
Or the violence of the dog days
Out on waves being tossed
Im on waves out being tossed
I swear Is there a line that we can just go cross
You were there
And I was catching my breath
Floors of a cabin creaking under my step
And I couldnt be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar
This pain wouldnt be for
Evermore
Evermore
Evermore
This pain wouldnt be for evermore
Friends break up friends get married
Strangers get born strangers get buried
Trends change rumors fly through new skies
But Im right where you left me
Matches burn after the other
Pages turn and stick to each other
Wages earned and lessons learned
But I Im right where you left me

Help Im still at the restaurant
Still sitting in a corner I haunt
Cross-legged in the dim light
They say What a sad sight
I I swear you could hear a hair pin drop
Right when I felt the moment stop
Glass shattered on the white cloth
Everybody moved on I I stayed there
Dust collected on my pinned-up hair
They expected me to find somewhere
Some perspective but I sat and stared
Right where you left me
You left me no you left me no
You left me no choice but to stay here forever
You left me you left me no oh you left me no
You left me no choice but to stay here forever

Did you ever hear about the girl who got frozen
Time went on for everybody else she wont know it
Shes still twenty-three inside her fantasy
How it was supposed to be
Did you hear about the girl who lives in delusion
Breakups happen every day you dont have to lose it
Shes still twenty-three inside her fantasy
And youre sitting in front of me

At the restaurant when I was still the one you want
Cross-legged in the dim light everything was just right
I I could feel the mascara run
You told me that you met someone
Glass shattered on the white cloth
Everybody moved on

Help Im still at the restaurant
Still sitting in a corner I haunt
Cross-legged in the dim light
They say What a sad sight
I I stayed there
Dust collected on my pinned-up hair
Im sure that you got a wife out there
Kids and Christmas but Im unaware
Cause Im right where I cause no harm
Mind my business
If our love died young
I cant bear witness
And its been so long
But if you ever think you got it wrong
Im right where
You left me
You left me no oh you left me no
You left me no choice but to stay here forever
You left me
You left me no oh you left me no
When the dinner is cold and the chatter gets old
You ask for the tab
Or that moment again hes insisting that friends
Look at each other like that
When the words of a sister come back in whispers
That prove she was not in fact what she seemed
Not a twin from your dreams
Shes a crook who was caught

That old familiar body ache
The snaps from the same little breaks in your soul
You know when its time to go
Twenty years at your job
Then the son of the boss gets the spot that was yours
Or trying to stay for the kids
When keeping it how it is will only break their hearts worse

That old familiar body ache
The snaps from the same little breaks in your soul
You know when its time to go

Sometimes giving up is the strong thing
Sometimes to run is the brave thing
Sometimes walking out is the one thing
That will find you the right thing
Sometimes giving up is the strong thing
Sometimes to run is the brave thing
Sometimes walking out is the one thing
That will find you the right thing

Fifteen years fifteen million tears
Begging til my knees bled
I gave it my all he gave me nothing at all
Then wondered why I left
Now he sits on his throne in his palace of bones
Praying to his greed
Hes got my past frozen behind glass
But Ive got me
That old familiar body ache
The snaps from the same little breaks in my soul
I know when its time to go

Sometimes giving up is the strong thing
Sometimes to run is the brave thing
Sometimes walking out is the one thing
That will find you the right thing
Sometimes giving up is the strong thing
Sometimes to run is the brave thing
Sometimes walking out is the one thing
That will find you the right thing

That will find you the right thing
And you know in your soul
You know in your soul
When its time to go
You know you know you know you know
When its time to go
So then you go
Then you go
To put it plainly we just couldnt stop writing songs To try and put it more poetically it feels like we were standing on the edge of the folklorian woods and had a choice to turn and go back or to travel further into the forest of this music We chose to wander deeper in and my collaborators and I are proud to announce that my 9th studio album and folklores sister record is here Its called evermore
Ive never done this before In the past Ive always treated albums as onе-off eras and moved onto planning the nеxt one as soon as an album was released There was something different with folklore In making it I felt less like I was departing and more like I was returning I loved the escapism I found in these imaginary/not imaginary tales I loved the ways you welcomed the dreamscapes and tragedies and epic tales of love lost and found So I just kept writing them And I loved creating these songs with Aaron Dessner Jack Antonoff WB and Justin Vernon Weve also welcomed some new and longtime friends to our musical kitchen table this time around
Before I knew it there were 17 tales some of which are mirrored or intersecting with one another The one about two young con artists who fall in love while hanging out at fancy resorts trying to score rich romantic beneficiaries The one where longtime college sweethearts had very different plans for the same night one to end it and one who brought a ring Dorothea the girl who left her small town to chase down Hollywood dreams - and what happens when she comes back for the holidays and rediscovers an old flame The unhappily ever after anthology of marriages gone bad that includes infidelity ambivalent toleration and even murder The most righteous motive to avenge the fallen The realization that maybe the only path to healing is to wish happiness on the one who took it away from you One starring my grandmother Marjorie who still visits me sometimesif only in my dreams
I wanted to surprise you with this the week of my 31st birthday Youve all been so caring supportive and thoughtful on my birthdays and so this time I wanted to give you something I also know this holiday season will be a lonely one for most of us and of there are any of you out there who turn to music to cope with missing loved ones the way I do this is for you
I have no idea what will come next I have no idea about a lot of things these days and so Ive clung to the one thing that keeps me connected to you all That thing always has and always will be music
I like the way you sound in the morning
Were on the phone and without a warning
I realize your laugh is the best sound
I have ever heard
I like the way I cant keep my focus
I watch you talk you didnt notice
I hear the words but all I can think is
We should be together

Every time you smile I smile
And every time you shine Ill shine for you
Whoa oh Im feeling you baby
Dont be afraid to
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me
Baby Im never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
Cause Ima stay through it all
So jump then fall

Well I like the way your hair falls in your face
You got the keys to me
I love each freckle on your face oh
Ive never been so wrapped up honey
I like the way youre everything I ever wanted
I had time to think it o-over
And all I can say is come closer
Take a deep breath and  jump then fall into me

Cause every time you smile I smile
And every time you shine Ill shine for you

Whoa oh Im feeling you baby
Dont be afraid to
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me
Baby Im never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
Cause Ima stay through it all
So jump then fall
The bottoms gonna drop out from under our feet
Ill catch you Ill catch you
When people say things that bring you to your knees
Ill catch you
The time is gonna come when youre so mad you could cry
But Ill hold you through the night until you smile

Whoa oh I need you baby
Dont be afraid please
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me
Baby Im never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
Cause Ima stay through it all
So jump then fall
Jump then fall baby
Jump then fall into me into me

Every time you smile I smile
And every time you shine I shine
And every time youre here
Baby Ill show you Ill show you
You can jump then fall jump then fall
Untouchable like a distant diamond sky
Im reaching out and I just cant tell you why
Im caught up in you Im caught up in you

Untouchable burning brighter than the sun
And when youre close I feel like coming undone

In the middle of the night when Im in this dream
Its like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on come on say that well be together
Come on come on little taste of heaven
Its half full and I wont wait here all day
I know youre saying that youd be here anyway

But youre untouchable burning brighter than the sun
And now that youre close I feel like coming undone

In the middle of the night when Im in this dream
Its like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on come on say that well be together
Come on come on oh
In the middle of the night waking from this dream
I want to feel you by my side standing next to me
You got to come on come on say that well be together
Come on come on little taste of heaven

Im caught up in you
Oh-oh oh oh-oh
But youre untouchable burning brighter than the sun
Now that youre close I feel like coming undone

In the middle of the night when Im in this dream
Its like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on come on say that well be together
Come on come on oh-oh-oh
In the middle of the night when Im in this dream
Its like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on come on say that well be together
Come on come on come on
In the middle of the night waking from this dream
I want to feel you by my side standing next to me
You got to come on come on say that well be together
Come on come on little taste of heaven
Oh-oh oh-oh-oh oh
And in the middle of the night when Im in this dream
Its like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on come on oh come on come on
Come on come on oh oh oh oh
Like a million little stars spelling out your name
Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
We caught onto something
I hold onto the night
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding
Cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down we almost never speak
I dont feel welcome anymore
Baby what happened Please tell me
Cause one second it was perfect
Now youre halfway out the door
And I stare at the phone he still hasnt called
And then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said Forever and always
Oh and it rains in your bedroom everything is wrong
It rains when youre here and it rains when youre gone
I was there when you said Forever and always

Was I out of line
Did I say something way too honest made you run and hide
Like a scared little boy
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute now Im not so sure
So heres to everything coming down to nothing
Heres to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going
Thought I knew for a minute but I dont anymore

And I stare at the phone he still hasnt called
And then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said Forever and always
And it rains in your bedroom everything is wrong
It rains when youre here and it rains when youre gone
I was there when you said Forever and always
You didnt mean it baby
I dont think so

Oh oh-oh oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh oh-oh-oh oh
Back up baby back up
Did you forget everything
Back up baby back up
Did you forget everything
Back up baby back up
Please back up oh back up
Back up baby back up

Cause it rains in your bedroom everything is wrong
It rains when youre here and it rains when youre gone
I was there when you said Forever and always
And I stare at the phone he still hasnt called
And then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when we said Forever and always
Cause it rains in your bedroom everything is wrong
It rains when youre here and it rains when youre gone
I was there when you said Forever and always
You didnt mean it baby
I could go back to every laugh
But I dont wanna go there anymore
And I know all the steps up to your door
But I dont wanna go there anymore

Talk to the wind talk to the sky
Talk to the man with the reasons why
And let me know what you find
Ill leave my window open
Cause Im too tired at night to call your name
Just know Im right here hoping
That youll come in with the rain

I could stand up and sing you a song
But I dont wanna have to go that far
And I Ive got you down I know you by heart
And you dont even know where I start

Talk to yourself talk to the tears
Talk to the man who put you here
And dont wait for the sky to clear

Ill leave my window open
Cause Im too tired at night to call your name
Just know Im right here hoping
That youll come in with the rain

Ive watched you so long screamed your name
I dont know what else I can say
But Ill leave my window open
Cause Im too tired at night for all these games
Just know Im right here hoping
That youll come in with the rain

I could go back to every laugh
This is wrong but I cant help but feel like
There ain’t nothing more right babe
Misty morning comes again and I cant
Help but wish I could see your face
And I knew from the first note played
Id be breaking all my rules to see you
You smile that beautiful smile and all the girls in the front row
Scream your name

So dim that spotlight tell me things like
I cant take my eyes off of you
Im no one special just another wide-eyed girl
Whos desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall superstar
Good morning loneliness
Comes around when Im not dreaming about you
When my world wakes up today
Youll be in another town
And I knew when I saw your face
Id be counting down the ways to see you
You smile that beautiful smile and all the girls in the front row Scream your name

So dim that spotlight tell me things like
I cant take my eyes off of you
Im no one special just another wide-eyed girl
Whos desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall superstar

You played in bars you play guitar
And Im invisible and everyone knows who you are
And youll never see you sing me to sleep
Every night from the radio

So dim that spotlight tell me things like
I cant take my eyes off of you
Im no one special just another wide-eyed girl
Whos desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall superstar
Sweet sweet superstar
In the heat of the fight I walked away
Ignoring words that you were saying
Tryin to make me stay
I said This time Ive had enough
And youve called a hundred times
But Im not picking up

Cause Im so mad
I might tell you that its over
But if you look a little closer
I said Leave but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming Im in love with you
Wait there in the pouring rain coming back for more
And dont you leave cause I know all I need is on
The other side of the door

Me and my stupid pride are sitting here alone
Going through the photographs staring at the phone
I keep going back over things we both said
And I remember the slamming door
And all the things that I misread

So babe if you know everything
Tell me why you couldnt see
When I left I wanted you to chase after me yeah

I said Leave but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming Im in love with you
Wait there in the pouring rain coming back for more
And dont you leave cause I know all I need is on
The other side of the door
And Ill scream out the window
I cant even look at you
I dont need you but I do I do I do
Ill say Theres nothing you can say
To make this right again I mean it I mean it
What I mean is

I said Leave but baby all I want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming Im in love with you
Wait there in the pouring rain coming back for more
And dont you leave cause I know all I need is on
The other side of the door

With your face and the beautiful eyes
And the conversation with the little white lies
And the faded picture of a beautiful night
You carried me from your car up the stairs
And I broke down crying was she worth this mess
After everything and that little black dress
Theres something bout the way
The street looks when its just rained
Theres a glow off the pavement you walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot yeah
Oh yeah

Were driving down the road I wonder if you know
Im trying so hard not to get caught up now
But youre just so cool run your hands through your hair
Absentmindedly making me want you
And I dont know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first fearless
And I dont know why but with you Id dance
In a storm in my best dress fearless

So baby drive slow til we run out of road
In this one horse town I wanna stay right here
In this passengers seat
You put your eyes on me
In this moment now capture it remember it

Cause I dont know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first fearless
And I dont know why but with you Id dance
In a storm in my best dress fearless

Well you stood there with me in the doorway
My hands shake Im not usually this way but
You pull me in and Im a little more brave
Its the first kiss its flawless really something
Its fearless
Oh yeah
Cause I dont know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first fearless
And I dont know why but with you Id dance
In a storm in my best dress fearless
Cause I dont know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first fearless
And I dont know why but with you Id dance
In a storm in my best dress fearless

Oh oh
You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
Its the mornin of your very first day
You say hi to your friends you aint seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybodys way
Its your freshman year and youre gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hopin one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
You know I havent seen you around before

Cause when youre fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
Youre gonna believe them
And when youre fifteen feelin like theres nothin to figure out
Well count to ten take it in
This is life before you know who youre gonna be
Fifteen
You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough youre best friends
Laughin at the other girls who think theyre so cool
Well be outta here as soon as we can
And then youre on your very first date and hes got a car
And youre feelin like flyin
And your mamas waitin up and youre thinkin hes the one
And youre dancin round your room when the night ends
When the night ends

Cause when youre fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
Youre gonna believe them
And when youre fifteen and your first kiss
Makes your head spin round
But in your life youll do things greater than
Dating the boy on the football team
But I didnt know it at fifteen

When all you wanted was to be wanted
Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
And Abigail gave everything she had
To a boy who changed his mind
And we both cried
Cause when youre fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
Youre gonna believe them
And when youre fifteen dont forget to look before you fall
Ive found time can heal most anything
And you just might find who youre supposed to be
I didnt know who I was supposed to be
At fifteen

La-la-la la-la-la la-la-la-la
La-la-la la-la-la la-la-la-la
La-la-la la-la-la

Your very first day
Take a deep breath girl
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
Im standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights see the party the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say Hello
Little did I know

That you were Romeo you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said Stay away from Juliet
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you Please dont go and I said
Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
Ill be waiting all theres left to do is run
Youll be the prince and Ill be the princess
Its a love story baby just say Yes

So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet cause were dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while oh oh

Cause you were Romeo I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said Stay away from Juliet
But you were everything to me
I was begging you Please dont go and I said

Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
Ill be waiting all theres left to do is run
Youll be the prince and Ill be the princess
Its a love story baby just say Yes
Romeo save me theyre trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult but its real
Dont be afraid well make it out of this mess
Its a love story baby just say Yes
Oh oh

I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town

And I said Romeo save me Ive been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head I dont know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said

Marry me Juliet youll never have to be alone
I love you and thats all I really know
I talked to your dad go pick out a white dress
Its a love story baby just say Yes

Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Mmm-mm mm-mm
Mmm-mm mm-mm
Mmm-mm mm-mm yeah

Hey Stephen I know looks can be deceiving
But I know I saw a light in you
And as we walked we were talking
I didnt say half the things I wanted to
Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
Ill be the one waiting there even when its cold
Hey Stephen boy you might have me believing
I dont always have to be alone
Cause I cant help it if you look like an angel
Cant help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic Ive been feeling since I met you
Cant help it if theres no one else
Mmm I cant help myself

Hey Stephen Ive been holding back this feeling
So I got some things to say to you ha
Ive seen it all so I thought
But I never seen nobody shine the way you do
The way you walk way you talk way you say my name
Its beautiful wonderful dont you ever change
Hey Stephen why are people always leaving
I think you and I should stay the same

Cause I cant help it if you look like an angel
Cant help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic Ive been feeling since I met you
Cant help it if theres no one else
Mmm I cant help myself

Theyre dimming the street lights youre perfect for me
Why arent you here tonight
Im waiting alone now so come on and come out
And pull me near and shine shine shine
Hey Stephen I could give you fifty reasons
Why I should be the one you choose
All those other girls well theyre beautiful
But would they write a song for you Ha-ha

I cant help it if you look like an angel
Cant help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic Ive been feeling since I met you
Cant help it if theres no one else
Mmm I cant help myself
If you look like an angel
Cant help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic Ive been feeling since I met you
Cant help it if theres no one else
Mmm I cant help myself

Myself
Cant help myself
Say youre sorry that face of an angel
Comes out just when you need it to
As I paced back and forth all this time
Cause I honestly believed in you
Holdin on the days drag on
Stupid girl I shoulda known I shoulda known

That Im not a princess this aint a fairytale
Im not the one youll sweep off her feet lead her up the stairwell
This aint Hollywood this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now its too late for you and your white horse
To come around
Maybe I was naive got lost in your eyes
And never really had a chance
My mistake I didnt know to be in love
You had to fight to have the upper hand
I had so many dreams about you and me
Happy endings now I know

That Im not a princess this aint a fairytale
Im not the one youll sweep off her feet lead her up the stairwell
This aint Hollywood this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now its too late for you and your white horse
To come around

And there you are on your knees
Beggin for forgiveness beggin for me
Just like I always wanted
But Im so sorry

Cause Im not your princess this aint our fairytale
Im gonna find someone someday who might actually treat me well
This is a big world that was a small town
There in my rear view mirror disappearing now
And its too late for you and your white horse
Now its too late for you and your white horse
To catch me now
Oh whoa whoa whoa
Try and catch me now oh
Youre on the phone with your girlfriend shes upset
Shes going off about something that you said
Cause she doesnt get your humor like I do
Im in the room its a typical Tuesday night
Im listening to the kind of music she doesnt like
And shell never know your story like I do

But she wears short skirts I wear T-shirts
Shes Cheer Captain and Im on the bleachers
Dreaming bout the day when you wake up and find
That what youre looking for has been here the whole time
If you could see that Im the one who understands you
Been here all along so why cant you see
You belong with me you belong with me

Walking the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I cant help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench thinking to myself
Hey isnt this easy
And youve got a smile that could light up this whole town
I havent seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say youre fine I know you better than that
Hey whatcha doing with a girl like that

She wears high heels I wear sneakers
Shes Cheer Captain and Im on the bleachers
Dreaming bout the day when you wake up and find
That what youre looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see that Im the one who understands you
Been here all along so why cant you see
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know baby
You belong with me you belong with me
Oh I remember you driving to my house
In the middle of the night
Im the one who makes you laugh
When you know youre bout to cry
And I know your favorite songs
And you tell me bout your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know its with me

Cant you see that Im the one who understands you
Been here all along so why cant you see
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know baby
You belong with me you belong with me

You belong with me
Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me
I see your face in my mind as I drive away
Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way
People are people and sometimes we change our minds
But its killing me to see you go after all this time

Music starts playing like the end of a sad movie
Its the kind of ending you dont really wanna see
Cause its tragedy and itll only bring you down
Now I dont know what to be without you around
And we know its never simple never easy
Never a clean break no one here to save me
Youre the only thing I know like the back of my hand

And I cant breathe without you but I have to
Breathe without you but I have to

Never wanted this never wanna see you hurt
Every little bump in the road I tried to swerve
But people are people and sometimes it doesnt work out
Nothing we say is gonna save us from the fall out

And we know its never simple never easy
Never a clean break no one here to save me
Youre the only thing I know like the back of my hand

And I cant breathe without you but I have to
Breathe without you but I have to

Its 2 AM feeling like I just lost a friend
Hope you know its not easy easy for me
Its 2 AM feeling like I just lost a friend
Hope you know this aint easy easy for me
And we know its never simple never easy
Never a clean break no one here to save me oh-oh

I cant breathe without you but I have to
Breathe without you but I have to
Breathe without you but I have to

Im sorry Im sorry Mmm
Im sorry Yeah yeah Im sorry
Im sorry Im sorry
I took a chance I took a shot
And you might think Im bulletproof but Im not
You took a swing I took it hard
And down here from the ground I see who you are

Im sick and tired of your attitude
Im feeling like I dont know you
You tell me that you love me then cut me down
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
That makes me run for cover when youre around
And heres to you and your temper
Yes I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what youre doing to me
Tell me why
You could write a book on how to ruin someones perfect day
Well I get so confused and frustrated
Forget what Im trying to say oh

Im sick and tired of your reasons
I got no one to believe in
You tell me that you want me then push me around
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
That makes me run for cover when youre around
Heres to you and your temper
Yes I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what youre doing to me
Tell me why

Why do you have to make me feel small
So you can feel whole inside
Why do you have to put down my dreams
So youre the only thing on my mind

Im sick and tired of your attitude
Im feeling like I dont know you
You tell me that you want me then cut me down
Im sick and tired of your reasons
Ive got no one to believe in
You ask me for my love then you push me around
Heres to you and your temper
Yes I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what youre doing to me
Tell me why Why
Tell me why Why
I take a step back let you go
I told you Im not bulletproof
All this time I was wasting hoping you would come around
Ive been giving out chances every time and all you do is let me down
And its taken me this long baby but Ive figured you out
And youre thinking well be fine again but not this time around

You dont have to call anymore
I wont pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Dont wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that youre sorry
But I dont believe you baby like I did before
Youre not sorry No no no no
Youre looking so innocent I might believe you if I didnt know
Couldve loved you all my life if you hadnt left me waiting in the cold
And youve got your share of secrets
And Im tired of being last to know oh
And now youre asking me to listen cause its worked each time before

But you dont have to call anymore
I wont pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Dont wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that youre sorry
But I dont believe you baby like I did before
Youre not sorry No no no no
Youre not sorry No no no no

You had me crawling for you honey and it never wouldve gone away no
You used to shine so bright but I watched all of it fade

So you dont have to call anymore
I wont pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Theres nothing left to beg for
And you can tell me that youre sorry
But I dont believe you baby like I did before
Youre not sorry No no no no
Youre not sorry No no no no
No no no no no no no no no no no no
Woah oh oh-oh oh-oh-oh
He is sensible and so incredible
And all my single friends are jealous
He says everything I need to hear and its like
I couldnt ask for anything better
He opens up my door and I get into his car
And he says you look beautiful tonight
And I feel perfectly fine

But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And its 2AM and Im cursing your name
Youre so in love that you act insane
And thats the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
Its a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And thats the way I loved you
He respects my space
And never makes me wait
And he calls exactly when he says he will
Hes close to my mother
Talks business with my father
Hes charming and endearing
And Im comfortable

But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
Its 2AM and Im cursing your name
Youre so in love that you acted insane
And thats the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
Its a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And thats the way I loved you

He cant see the smile Im faking
And my hearts not breaking
Cause Im not feeling anything at all
And you were wild and crazy
Just so frustrating
Intoxicating complicated
Got away by some mistake and now
I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
Its 2AM and Im cursing your name
Im so in love that I acted insane
And thats the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
Its a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And thats the way I loved you oh oh

And thats the way I loved you oh oh
Never knew I could feel that much
Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold onto the night
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding
Cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down we almost never speak
I dont feel welcome anymore
Baby what happened Please tell me
Cause one second it was perfect
Now youre halfway out the door
And I stare at the phone he still hasnt called
And then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said Forever and always
Oh and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when youre here and it rains when youre gone
Cause I was there when you said Forever and always

Was I out of line
Did I say something way too honest made you run and hide
Like a scared little boy
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute now Im not so sure
So heres to everything coming down to nothing
Heres to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going
Thought I knew for a minute but I dont anymore

And I stare at the phone he still hasnt called
And then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said Forever and always
Oh and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when youre here and it rains when youre gone
Cause I was there when you said Forever and always
You didnt mean it baby I dont think so
Oh back up baby back up
Did you forget everything
Back up baby back up
Did you forget everything

Cause it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when youre here and it rains when youre gone
Cause I was there when you said Forever and always
Oh I stare at the phone he still hasnt called
And then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when we said Forever and always
And it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when youre here and it rains when youre gone
Cause I was there when you said Forever and always

You didnt mean it baby
Im five years old its getting cold Ive got my big coat on
I hear your laugh and look up smiling at you I run and run
Past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides
Look now the sky is gold
I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home

I dont know why all the trees change in the fall
But I know youre not scared of anything at all
Dont know if Snow Whites house is near or far away
But I know I had the best day with you today
Im thirteen now
And dont know how my friends could be so mean
I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys
And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away
And we talk and window shop til Ive forgotten all their names

I dont know who Im going to talk to now at school
But I know Im laughing on the car ride home with you
Dont know how long its going to take to feel okay
But I know I had the best day with you today

I have an excellent father his strength is making me stronger
God smiles on my little brother inside and out
Hes better than I am
I grew up in a pretty house and I had space to run
And I had the best days with you

There is a video I found from back when I was three
You set up a paint set in the kitchen and youre talking to me
Its the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarfs
And Daddys smart
And youre the prettiest lady in the whole wide world
And now I know why all the trees change in the fall
I know you were on my side even when I was wrong
And I love you for giving me your eyes
For staying back and watching me shine
And I didnt know if you knew so Im taking this chance to say
And its a sad picture the final blow hits you
Somebody else gets what you wanted again and
You know its all the same another time and place
Repeating history and youre getting sick of it
But I believe in whatever you do
And Ill do anything to see it through

Because these things will change
Can you feel it now
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution the time will come
For us to finally win
And well sing hallelujah well sing hallelujah
Oh oh
So weve been outnumbered raided and now cornered
Its hard to fight when the fight ain’t fair
Were getting stronger now find things they never found
They might be bigger but were faster and never scared
You can walk away say we dont need this
But theres something in your eyes says we can beat this

Cause these things will change
Can you feel it now
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution the time will come
For us to finally win
And well sing hallelujah well sing hallelujah
Oh oh

Tonight we stand get off our knees
Fight for what weve worked for all these years
And the battle was long its the fight of our lives
But well stand up champions tonight

It was the night things changed
Can you see it now
These walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
Its a revolution throw your hands up
Cause we never gave in
And well sing hallelujah we sang hallelujah
Im doing good Im on some new shit
Been saying yes instead of no
I thought I saw you at the bus stop I didnt though
I hit the ground running each night
I hit the Sunday matinée
You know the greatest films of all time were never made

I guess you never know never know
And if you wanted me you really shouldve showed
And if you never bleed youre never gonna grow
And its alright now
But we were something dont you think so
Roaring twenties tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishes came true
It wouldve been you
In my defense I have none
For never leaving well enough alone
But it wouldve been fun
If you wouldve been the one
Ooh

I have this dream youre doing cool shit
Having adventures on your own
You meet some woman on the internet and take her home
We never painted by the numbers baby
But we were making it count
You know the greatest loves of all time are over now

I guess you never know never know
And its another day waking up alone

But we were something dont you think so
Roaring twenties tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishes came true
It wouldve been you
In my defense I have none
For never leaving well enough alone
But it wouldve been fun
If you wouldve been the one
I I I persist and resist the temptation to ask you
If one thing had been different
Would everything be different today

We were something dont you think so
Rosé flowing with your chosen family
And it wouldve been sweet
If it couldve been me
In my defense I have none
For digging up the grave another time
But it wouldve been fun
If you wouldve been the one
Vintage tee brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young they assume you know nothing
Sequin smile black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young they assume you know nothing

But I knew you
Dancin in your Levis
Drunk under a streetlight I
I knew you
Hand under my sweatshirt
Baby kiss it better I
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someones bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

A friend to all is a friend to none
Chase two girls lose the one
When you are young they assume you know nothing

But I knew you
Playing hide-and-seek and
Giving me your weekends I
I knew you
Your heartbeat on the High Line
Once in twenty lifetimes I

And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someones bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

To kiss in cars and downtown bars
Was all we needed
You drew stars around my scars
But now Im bleedin
Cause I knew you
Steppin on the last train
Marked me like a bloodstain I
I knew you
Tried to change the ending
Peter losing Wendy I
I knew you
Leavin like a father
Running like water I
And when you are young they assume you know nothing

But I knew youd linger like a tattoo kiss
I knew youd haunt all of my what-ifs
The smell of smoke would hang around this long
Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew Id curse you for the longest time
Chasin shadows in the grocery line
I knew youd miss me once the thrill expired
And youd be standin in my front porch light
And I knew youd come back to me
Youd come back to me
And youd come back to me
And youd come back
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someones bed
Rebekah rode up on the afternoon train it was sunny
Her saltbox house on the coast took her mind off St Louis
Bill was the heir to the Standard Oil name and money
And the town said How did a middle-class divorcée do it
The wedding was charming if a little gauche
Theres only so far new money goes
They picked out a home and called it Holiday House
Their parties were tasteful if a little loud
The doctor had told him to settle down
It must have been her fault his heart gave out
And they said
There goes the last great American dynasty
Who knows if she never showed up what couldve been
There goes the maddest woman this town has ever seen
She had a marvelous time ruining everything

Rebekah gave up on the Rhode Island set forever
Flew in all her Bitch Pack friends from the city
Filled the pool with champagne and swam with the big names
And blew through the money on the boys and the ballet
And losing on card game bets with Dalí

And they said
There goes the last great American dynasty
Who knows if she never showed up what couldve been
There goes the most shameless woman this town has ever seen
She had a marvelous time ruining everything

They say she was seen on occasion
Pacing the rocks staring out at the midnight sea
And in a feud with her neighbor
She stole his dog and dyed it key lime green
Fifty years is a long time
Holiday House sat quietly on that beach
Free of women with madness their men and bad habits
And then it was bought by me
Who knows if I never showed up what couldve been
There goes the loudest woman this town has ever seen
I had a marvelous time ruining everything

I had a marvelous time ruining everything
A marvelous time ruining everything
A marvelous time
I can see you standing honey
With his arms around your body
Laughin but the jokes not funny at all
And it took you five whole minutes
To pack us up and leave me with it
Holdin all this love out here in the hall

I think Ive seen this film before
And I didnt like the ending
Youre not my homeland anymore
So what am I defending now
You were my town now Im in exile seein you out
I think Ive seen this film before
Ooh ooh ooh

I can see you starin honey
Like hes just your understudy
Like youd get your knuckles bloody for me
Second third and hundredth chances
Balancin on breaking branches
Those eyes add insult to injury

I think Ive seen this film before
And I didnt like the ending
Im not your problem anymore
So who am I offending now
You were my crown now Im in exile seein you out
I think Ive seen this film before
So Im leaving out the side door
So step right out there is no amount
Of crying I can do for you
All this time
We always walked a very thin line
You didnt even hear me out You didnt even hear me out
You never gave a warning sign I gave so many signs
All this time
I never learned to read your mind Never learned to read my mind
I couldnt turn things around You never turned things around
Cause you never gave a warning sign I gave so many signs
So many signs so many signs
You didnt even see the signs
I think Ive seen this film before
And I didnt like the ending
Youre not my homeland anymore
So what am I defending now
You were my town now Im in exile seein you out
I think Ive seen this film before
So Im leavin out the side door

So step right out there is no amount
Of crying I can do for you
All this time
We always walked a very thin line
You didnt even hear me out Didnt even hear me out
You never gave a warning sign I gave so many signs
All this time
I never learned to read your mind Never learned to read my mind
I couldnt turn things around You never turned things around
Cause you never gave a warning sign I gave so many signs
You never gave a warning sign All this time
So many times I never learned to read your mind
So many signs I couldnt turn things around I couldnt turn things around
Cause you never gave a warning sign You never gave a warning sign
You never gave a warning sign
We gather here we line up weepin in a sunlit room
And if Im on fire youll be made of ashes too
Even on my worst day did I deserve babe
All the hell you gave me
Cause I loved you I swear I loved you
Til my dying day

I didnt have it in myself to go with grace
And youre the hero flying around saving face
And if Im dead to you why are you at the wake
Cursing my name wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet
We gather stones never knowing what theyll mean
Some to throw some to make a diamond ring
You know I didnt want to have to haunt you
But what a ghostly scene
You wear the same jewels that I gave you
As you bury me

I didnt have it in myself to go with grace
Cause when Id fight you used to tell me I was brave
And if Im dead to you why are you at the wake
Cursing my name wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet

And I can go anywhere I want
Anywhere I want just not home
And you can aim for my heart go for blood
But you would still miss me in your bones
And I still talk to you When Im screaming at the sky
And when you cant sleep at night You hear my stolen lullabies

I didnt have it in myself to go with grace
And so the battleships will sink beneath the waves
You had to kill me but it killed you just the same
Cursing my name wishing I stayed
You turned into your worst fears
And youre tossing out blame drunk on this pain
Crossing out the good years
And youre cursing my name wishing I stayed
I want you to know
Im a mirrorball
Ill show you every version of yourself tonight
Ill get you out on the floor
Shimmering beautiful
And when I break its in a million pieces

Hush when no one is around my dear
Youll find me on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels love
Shining just for you
Hush I know they said the end is near
But Im still on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels love
Shining just for you
I want you to know
Im a mirrorball
I can change everything about me to fit in
You are not like the regulars
The masquerade revelers
Drunk as they watch my shattered edges glisten

Hush when no one is around my dear
Youll find me on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels love
Shining just for you
Hush I know they said the end is near
But Im still on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels love
Shining just for you

And they called off the circus burned the disco down
When they sent home the horses and the rodeo clowns
Im still on that tightrope
Im still trying everything to get you laughing at me
And Im still a believer but I dont know why
Ive never been a natural all I do is try try try
Im still on that trapeze
Im still trying everything to keep you looking at me
Because Im a mirrorball
Im a mirrorball
Please picture me in the trees
I hit my peak at seven
Feet in the swing over the creek
I was too scared to jump in
But I I was high in the sky
With Pennsylvania under me
Are there still beautiful things

Sweet tea in the summer
Cross your heart wont tell no other
And though I can’t recall your face
I still got love for you
Your braids like a pattern
Love you to the Moon and to Saturn
Passed down like folk songs
The love lasts so long
And Ive been meaning to tell you
I think your house is haunted
Your dad is always mad and that must be why
And I think you should come live with me
And we can be pirates
Then you wont have to cry
Or hide in the closet
And just like a folk song
Our love will be passed on

Please picture me in the weeds
Before I learned civility
I used to scream ferociously
Any time I wanted
I I

Sweet tea in the summer
Cross my heart won’t tell no other
And though I cant recall your face
I still got love for you
Pack your dolls and a sweater
Well move to India forever
Passed down like folk songs
Salt air and the rust on your door
I never needed anything more
Whispers of Are you sure
Never have I ever before

But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
Cause you were never mine
Your back beneath the sun
Wishin I could write my name on it
Will you call when youre back at school
I remember thinkin I had you

But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
Cause you were never mine

Back when we were still changin for the better
Wanting was enough
For me it was enough
To live for the hope of it all
Cancel plans just in case youd call
And say Meet me behind the mall
So much for summer love and saying us
Cause you werent mine to lose
You werent mine to lose no

But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
Cause you were never mine
Cause you were never mine
Never mine
But do you remember
Remember when I pulled up and said Get in the car
And then canceled my plans just in case youd call
Back when I was livin for the hope of it all for the hope of it all
Meet me behind the mall
Remember when I pulled up and said Get in the car
And then canceled my plans just in case youd call
Back when I was livin for the hope of it all for the hope of it all
Meet me behind the mall
Remember when I pulled up and said Get in the car
And then canceled my plans just in case youd call
Back when I was livin for the hope of it all For the hope of it all
For the hope of it all for the hope of it all
Ive been having a hard time adjusting
I had the shiniest wheels now theyre rusting
I didnt know if youd care if I came back
I have a lot of regrets about that
Pulled the car off the road to the lookout
Couldve followed my fears all the way down
And maybe I dont quite know what to say
But Im here in your doorway

I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
They told me all of my cages were mental
So I got wasted like all my potential
And my words shoot to kill when Im mad
I have a lot of regrets about that
I was so ahead of the curve the curve became a sphere
Fell behind all my classmates and I ended up here
Pouring out my heart to a stranger
But I didnt pour the whiskey

I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying

At least Im trying

And its hard to be at a party when I feel like an open wound
Its hard to be anywhere these days when all I want is you
Youre a flashback in a film reel on the one screen in my town

And I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
And maybe I dont quite know what to say
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
Make sure nobody sees you leave
Hood over your head keep your eyes down
Tell your friends youre out for a run
You’ll be flushed when you return
Take the road less traveled by
Tell yourself you can always stop
What started in beautiful rooms
Ends with meetings in parking lots

And thats the thing about illicit affairs
And clandestine meetings and longing stares
Its born from just one single glance
But it dies and it dies and it dies
A million little times
Leave the perfume on the shelf
That you picked out just for him
So you leave no trace behind
Like you don’t even exist
Take the words for what they are
A dwindling mercurial high
A drug that only worked
The first few hundred times

And thats the thing about illicit affairs
And clandestine meetings and stolen stares
They show their truth one single time
But they lie and they lie and they lie
A million little times

And you wanna scream
Dont call me kid dont call me baby
Look at this godforsaken mess that you made me
You showed me colors you know I cant see with anyone else
Dont call me kid dont call me baby
Look at this idiotic fool that you made me
You taught me a secret language I cant speak with anyone else
And you know damn well
For you I would ruin myself
Green was the color of the grass
Where I used to read at Centennial Park
I used to think I would meet somebody there
Teal was the color of your shirt
When you were sixteen at the yogurt shop
You used to work at to make a little money

Time curious time
Gave me no compasses gave me no signs
Were there clues I didnt see
And isnt it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Bad was the blood of the song in the cab
On your first trip to LA
You ate at my favorite spot for dinner
Bold was the waitress on our three-year trip
Getting lunch down by the Lakes
She said I looked like an American singer

Time mystical time
Cutting me open then healing me fine
Were there clues I didnt see
And isnt it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

A string that pulled me
Out of all the wrong arms right into that dive bar
Something wrapped all of my past mistakes in barbed wire
Chains around my demons
Wool to brave the seasons
One single thread of gold
Tied me to you
Cold was the steel of my axe to grind
For the boys who broke my heart
Now I send their babies presents
Gold was the color of the leaves
When I showed you around Centennial Park
Hell was the journey but it brought me heaven

Time wondrous time
Gave me the blues and then purple-pink skies
And its cool
Baby with me
And isnt it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Me
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Ah-ah-ah
What did you think Id say to that
Does a scorpion sting when fighting back
They strike to kill and you know I will
You know I will
What do you sing on your drive home
Do you see my face in the neighbors lawn
Does she smile
Or does she mouth Fuck you forever

Every time you call me crazy I get more crazy
What about that
And when you say I seem angry I get more angry
And theres nothing like a mad woman
What a shame she went mad
No one likes a mad woman
You made her like that
And youll poke that bear til her claws come out
And you find something to wrap your noose around
And theres nothing like a mad woman

Now I breathe flames each time I talk
My cannons all firin at your yacht
They say move on but you know I wont
And women like hunting witches too
Doing your dirtiest work for you
Its obvious that wanting me dead
Has really brought you two together

Every time you call me crazy I get more crazy
What about that
And when you say I seem angry I get more angry

And theres nothing like a mad woman
What a shame she went mad
No one likes a mad woman
You made her like that
And youll poke that bear til her claws come out
And you find something to wrap your noose around
And theres nothing like a mad woman
Im taking my time taking my time
Cause you took everything from me
Watching you climb watching you climb
Over people like me
The master of spin has a couple side flings
Good wives always know
She should be mad should be scathing like me but

No one likes a mad woman
What a shame she went mad
Keep your helmet keep your life son
Just a flesh wound heres your rifle
Crawling up the beaches now
Sir I think hes bleeding out
And some things you just cant speak about

With you I serve with you I fall down down
Watch you breathe in watch you breathing out out
Something med school did not cover
Someones daughter someones mother
Holds your hand through plastic now
Doc I think shes crashing out
And some things you just cant speak about

Only twenty minutes to sleep
But you dream of some epiphany
Just one single glimpse of relief
To make some sense of what youve seen

With you I serve with you I fall down down Down
Watch you breathe in watch you breathing out out
With you I serve With you I serve with you I fall down Down down Down
Watch you breathe in Watch you breathe in watch you breathing out Out out Out

Only twenty minutes to sleep
But you dream of some epiphany
Just one single glimpse of relief
Betty I wont make assumptions
About why you switched your homeroom but
I think its cause of me
Betty one time I was riding on my skateboard
When I passed your house
Its like I couldnt breathe

You heard the rumors from Inez
You cant believe a word she says
Most times but this time it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you
But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me Would you want me
Would you tell me to go fuck myself
Or lead me to the garden
In the garden would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing
Im only seventeen I dont know anything
But I know I miss you

Betty I know where it all went wrong
Your favorite song was playing
From the far side of the gym
I was nowhere to be found
I hate the crowds you know that
Plus I saw you dance with him

You heard the rumors from Inez
You cant believe a word she says
Most times but this time it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you

But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me Would you want me
Would you tell me to go fuck myself
Or lead me to the garden
In the garden would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing
Im only seventeen I dont know anything
But I know I miss you
I was walking home on broken cobblestones
Just thinking of you when she pulled up like
A figment of my worst intentions
She said James get in lets drive
Those days turned into nights
Slept next to her but
I dreamt of you all summer long

Betty Im here on your doorstep
And I planned it out for weeks now
But its finally sinkin in
Betty right now is the last time
I can dream about what happens when
You see my face again

The only thing I wanna do
Is make it up to you
So I showed up at your party
Yeah I showed up at your party

Yeah I showed up at your party
Will you have me Will you love me
Will you kiss me on the porch
In front of all your stupid friends
If you kiss me will it be just like I dreamed it
Will it patch your broken wings
Im only seventeen I dont know anything
But I know I miss you
Standing in your cardigan
Kissin in my car again
Stopped at a streetlight
Our coming-of-age has come and gone
Suddenly this summer its clear
I never had the courage of my convictions
As long as danger is near
And its just around the corner darlin
Cause it lives in me
No I could never give you peace

But Im a fire and Ill keep your brittle heart warm
If your cascade ocean wave blues come
All these people think loves for show
But I would die for you in secret
The devils in the details but you got a friend in me
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace
Your integrity makes me seem small
You paint dreamscapes on the wall
I talk shit with my friends its like Im wasting your honor
And you know that Id swing with you for the fences
Sit with you in the trenches
Give you my wild give you a child
Give you the silence that only comes when two people understand each other
Family that I chose now that I see your brother as my brother
Is it enough
But theres robbers to the east clowns to the west
Id give you my sunshine give you my best
But the rain is always gonna come if youre standin with me

But Im a fire and Ill keep your brittle heart warm
If your cascade ocean wave blues come
All these people think loves for show
But I would die for you in secret
The devils in the details but you got a friend in me
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace
My only one
My smoking gun
My eclipsed sun
This has broken me down
My twisted knife
My sleepless night
My winless fight
This has frozen my ground

Stood on the cliffside screaming Give me a reason
Your faithless loves the only hoax I believe in
Dont want no other shade of blue but you
No other sadness in the world would do
My best laid plan
Your sleight of hand
My barren land
I am ash from your fire

Stood on the cliffside screaming Give me a reason
Your faithless loves the only hoax I believe in
Dont want no other shade of blue but you
No other sadness in the world would do

You know I left a part of me back in New York
You knew the hero died so whats the movie for
You knew it still hurts underneath my scars
From when they pulled me apart
You knew the password so I let you in the door
You knew you won so whats the point of keeping score
You knew it still hurts underneath my scars
From when they pulled me apart
But what you did was just as dark
Ah ah ah
Darling this was just as hard
As when they pulled me apart
My only one
My kingdom come undone
My broken drum
You have beaten my heart
Dont want no other shade of blue but you
Is it romantic how all my elegies eulogize me
Im not cut out for all these cynical clones
These hunters with cell phones

Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die
I dont belong and my beloved neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
Im setting off but not without my muse
What should be over burrowed under my skin
In heart-stopping waves of hurt
Ive come too far to watch some namedropping sleaze
Tell me what are my words worth

Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die
I dont belong and my beloved neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
Im setting off but not without my muse

I want auroras and sad prose
I want to watch wisteria grow right over my bare feet
Cause I havent moved in years
And I want you right here
A red rose grew up out of ice frozen ground
With no one around to tweet it
While I bathe in cliffside pools
With my calamitous love and insurmountable grief

Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die
I dont belong and my beloved neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
Im setting off but not without my muse
Stars drawn around scars A cardigan that still bears the scent of loss twenty years later Battleships sinking into the ocean down down down The tree swing in the woods of my childhood Hushed tones of lets run away and never doing it The sun drenched month of August sipped away like a bottle of wine A mirrored disco ball hovering above a dance floor A whiskey bottle beckoning Hands held through plastic A single thread that for better or for worse ties you to your fate
Pretty soon these images in my head grew faces or names and became characters I found myself not only writing my own stories but also writing about or from the perspective of people Ive never met people Ive known or those I wish I hadnt An exiled man walking the bluffs of a land that isnt his own wondering how it all went so terribly terribly wrong An embittered tormentor showing up at the funeral of his fallen object of obsession A seventeen-year-old standing on a porch learning to apologize Lovestruck kids wandering up and down the evergreen High Line My grandfather Dean landing at Guadalcanal in 1942 A misfit widow getting gleeful revenge on the town that cast her out
A tale that becomes folklore is one that is passed down and whispered around Sometimes even sung about The lines between fantasy and reality blur and the boundaries between truth and diction become almost indiscernible Speculation over time becomes fact Myths ghost stories and fables Fairytales and parables Gossip and legend Someones secrets written in the sky for all to behold
In isolation my imagination has run wild and this album is the result a collection of songs and stories that flowed like a stream of consciousness Picking up a pen was my way of escaping into fantasy history and memory Ive told these stories to the best of my ability with all the love wonder and whimsy they deserve
How many days did I spend thinking
Bout how you did me wrong wrong wrong
Lived in the shade you were throwing
Til all of my sunshine was gone gone gone
And I couldnt get away from ya
In my feelings more than Drake so yeah
Your name on my lips tongue-tied
Free rent living in my mind

But then something happened one magical night
I forgot that you existed
And I thought that it would kill me but it didnt
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed
It isnt love it isnt hate its just indifference
I forgot that you

Got out some popcorn
As soon as my rep started going down down down
Laughed on the school yard
As soon as I tripped up and hit the ground ground ground
And I wouldve stuck around for ya
Wouldve fought the whole town so yeah
Wouldve been right there front row
Even if nobody came to your show

But you showed who you are then one magical night

I forgot that you existed
And I thought that it would kill me but it didnt
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed
It isnt love it isnt hate its just indifference
I forgot that you
Sent me a clear message
Taught me some hard lessons
I just forget what they were
Its all just a blur

I forgot that you existed
And I thought that it would kill me but it didnt
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed
I did I did I did
It isnt hate its just indifference
It isnt love it isnt hate its just indifference
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it Oh yeah youre right I want it
Bad bad boy shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it Oh yeah youre right I want it

Killing me slow out the window
Im always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice angels roll their eyes
What doesnt kill me makes me want you more
And its new the shape of your body
Its blue the feeling Ive got
And its ooh whoa oh
Its a cruel summer
Its cool thats what I tell em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh whoa oh
Its a cruel summer
With you

Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine
Im not dying Oh yeah youre right I want it
We say that well just screw it up in these trying times
Were not trying Oh yeah youre right I want it

So cut the headlights summers a knife
Im always waiting for you just to cut to the bone
Devils roll the dice angels roll their eyes
And if I bleed youll be the last to know

Oh its new the shape of your body
Its blue the feeling Ive got
And its ooh whoa oh
Its a cruel summer
Its cool thats what I tell em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh whoa oh
Its a cruel summer
With you
Im drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar Oh
Said Im fine but it wasnt true
I dont wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate Oh
And I scream For whatever its worth
I love you aint that the worst thing you ever heard
He looks up grinning like a devil

Its new the shape of your body
Its blue the feeling Ive got
And its ooh whoa oh
Its a cruel summer
Its cool thats what I tell em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh whoa oh
Its a cruel summer
With you

Im drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar Oh
Said Im fine but it wasnt true
I dont wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate Oh
And I scream For whatever its worth
I love you aint that the worst thing you ever heard
We could leave the Christmas lights up til January
And this is our place we make the rules
And theres a dazzling haze a mysterious way about you dear
Have I known you twenty seconds or twenty years
Can I go where you go
Can we always be this close
Forever and ever ah
Take me out and take me home
Youre my my my my lover
We could let our friends crash in the living room
This is our place we make the call
And Im highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
Ive loved you three summers now honey but I want em all
Can I go where you go
Can we always be this close
Forever and ever ah
Take me out and take me home Forever and ever
Youre my my my my lover

Ladies and gentlemen will you please stand
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
My hearts been borrowed and yours has been blue
Alls well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
And youll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table Ill save you a seat lover
Can I go where you go
Can we always be this close
Forever and ever ah
Take me out and take me home Forever and ever
Youre my my my my
Oh youre my my my my
I would be complex I would be cool
Theyd say I played the field before I found someone to commit to
And that would be okay for me to do
Every conquest I had made would make me more of a boss to you

I’d be a fearless leader
Id be an alpha type
When everyone believes ya
Whats that like
I’m so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if Id get there quicker if I was a man
And Im so sick of them coming at me again
Cause if I was a man then Id be the man
Id be the man
Id be the man

Theyd say I hustled put in the work
They wouldn’t shake their heads and question how much of this I deserve
What I was wearing if I was rude
Could all be separated from my good ideas and power moves

And they would toast to me oh let the players play
I’d be just like Leo in Saint-Tropez

Im so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if I’d get there quicker if I was a man
And Im so sick of them coming at me again
Cause if I was a man then Id be the man
I’d be the man
Id be the man
Whats it like to brag about raking in dollars
And getting bitches and models
And its all good if youre bad
And its okay if youre mad
If I was out flashing my dollars
Id be a bitch not a baller
Theyd paint me out to be bad
So its okay that Im mad

Im so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if Id get there quicker if I was a man You know that
And Im so sick of them coming at me again Coming at me again
Cause if I was a man If I was a man
Then Id be the man Then Id be the man
Im so sick of running as fast as I can As fast as I can
Wondering if Id get there quicker if I was a man Hey
And Im so sick of them coming at me again Coming at me again
Cause if I was a man If I was a man then Id be the man
Id be the man
Id be the man Oh
Id be the man Yeah
Id be the man Id be the man

Combat Im ready for combat
I say I dont want that but what if I do
Cause cruelty wins in the movies
Ive got a hundred thrown-out speeches I almost said to you

Easy they come easy they go
I jump from the train I ride off alone
I never grew up its getting so old
Help me hold on to you
Ive been the archer Ive been the prey
Who could ever leave me darling
But who could stay

Dark side I search for your dark side
But what if Im alright right right right here
And I cut off my nose just to spite my face
Then I hate my reflection for years and years

I wake in the night I pace like a ghost
The room is on fire invisible smoke
And all of my heroes die all alone
Help me hold on to you

Ive been the archer Ive been the prey
Screaming who could ever leave me darling
But who could stay
I see right through me I see right through me

Cause they see right through me
They see right through me
They see right through
Can you see right through me
They see right through
They see right through me
I see right through me
I see right through me
All the kings horses all the kings men
Couldnt put me together again
Cause all of my enemies started out friends
Help me hold on to you

Ive been the archer Ive been the prey
Who could ever leave me darling
But who could stay
I see right through me I see right through me
Who could stay
Who could stay
Who could stay
You could stay
You could stay

You know I adore you Im crazier for you
Than I was at 16 lost in a film scene
Waving homecoming queens marching band playing
Im lost in the lights
American glory faded before me
Now Im feeling hopeless ripped up my prom dress
Running through rose thorns I saw the scoreboard
And ran for my life Ah

No cameras catch my pageant smile
I counted days I counted miles
To see you there to see you there
Its been a long time coming but
Its you and me thats my whole world
They whisper in the hallway Shes a bad bad girl Okay
The whole school is rolling fake dice
You play stupid games you win stupid prizes
Its you and me theres nothing like this
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince Okay
Were so sad we paint the town blue
Voted most likely to run away with you

My team is losing battered and bruising
I see the high fives between the bad guys
Leave with my head hung you are the only one
Who seems to care
American stories burning before me
Im feeling helpless the damsels are depressed
Boys will be boys then where are the wise men
Darling Im scared Ah

No cameras catch my muffled cries
I counted days I counted miles
To see you there to see you there
And now the storm is coming but
Its you and me thats my whole world
They whisper in the hallway Shes a bad bad girl Okay
The whole school is rolling fake dice
You play stupid games you win stupid prizes
Its you and me theres nothing like this
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince Okay

They whisper in the hallway Shes a bad bad girl
The moon is high
Like your friends were the night that we first met
Went home and tried to stalk you on the internet
Now Ive read all of the books beside your bed
The wine is cold
Like the shoulder that I gave you in the street
Cat and mouse for a month or two or three
Now I wake up in the night and watch you breathe

Ayy
Kiss me once cause you know I had a long night Oh
Kiss me twice cause its gonna be alright Uh
Three times cause I waited my whole life 1 2 1 2 3 4

Darling youre the one I want and
I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this
Uh huh thats right
Darling youre the one I want
In paper rings in picture frames in dirty dreams
Oh youre the one I want

In the winter in the icy outdoor pool
When you jumped in first I went in too
Im with you even if it makes me blue
Which takes me back
To the color that we painted your brothers wall
Honey without all the exes fights and flaws
We wouldnt be standing here so tall so

Ayy

Kiss you twice cause its gonna be alright Uh
Three times cause you waited your whole life 1 2 1 2 3 4

Youre the one I want one I want
We were in the backseat
Drunk on something stronger than the drinks in the bar
I rent a place on Cornelia Street
I say casually in the car
We were a fresh page on the desk
Filling in the blanks as we go
As if the street lights pointed in an arrow head
Leading us home

And I hope I never lose you hope it never ends
Id never walk Cornelia Street again
Thats the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
Id never walk Cornelia Street again
And baby I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby Im so terrified of if you ever walk away
Id never walk Cornelia Street again
Id never walk Cornelia Street again
Windows flung right open autumn air
Jacket round my shoulders is yours
We bless the rains on Cornelia Street
Memorize the creaks in the floor
Back when we were card sharks playing games
I thought you were leading me on
I packed my bags left Cornelia Street
Before you even knew I was gone

But then you called showed your hand
I turned around before I hit the tunnel
Sat on the roof you and I

I hope I never lose you hope it never ends
Id never walk Cornelia Street again
Thats the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
Id never walk Cornelia Street again
And baby I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby Im so terrified of if you ever walk away
Id never walk Cornelia Street again
Id never walk Cornelia Street again
You hold my hand on the street
Walk me back to that apartment
Years ago we were just inside
Barefoot in the kitchen
Sacred new beginnings
That became my religion listen
I hope I never lose you
Id never walk Cornelia Street again
Oh never again
And baby I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby Im so terrified of if you ever walk away
Id never walk Cornelia Street again
Id never walk Cornelia Street again

I dont wanna lose you Hope it never ends
Id never walk Cornelia Street again
I dont wanna lose you Yeah

I rent a place on Cornelia Street
My my my my
My my my my
My my my my
My my my my
My my my my
My my my my
My my my my
My my my my

Saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up
I get drunk but its not enough
’Cause the morning comes and youre not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandeliers still flickering here
’Cause I cant pretend its okay when its not
Its death by a thousand cuts
I dress to kill my time I take the long way home
I ask the traffic lights if itll be alright
They say I dont know
And what once was ours is no ones now
I see you everywhere the only thing we share
Is this small town
You said it was a great love one for the ages
But if the story’s over why am I still writing pages

’Cause saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up
I get drunk but its not enough
’Cause the morning comes and youre not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandeliers still flickering here
Cause I can’t pretend its okay when its not
Its death by a thousand cuts

My heart my hips my body my love
Tryna find a part of me that you didnt touch
Gave up on me like I was a bad drug
Now Im searching for signs in a haunted club
Our songs our films united we stand
Our country guess it was a lawless land
Quiet my fears with the touch of your hand
Paper cut stings from our paper-thin plans
My time my wine my spirit my trust
Tryna find a part of me you didnt take up
Gave you so much but it wasnt enough
But Ill be alright its just a thousand cuts
I get drunk but its not enough
Cause youre not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandeliers still flickering here
Cause I cant pretend its okay when its not
No its not
Its death by a thousand cuts You didnt touch

Tryna find a part of me that you didnt touch
My body my love my trust Its death by a thousand cuts
But it wasnt enough it wasnt enough no no

I take the long way home
I ask the traffic lights if itll be alright
We can go driving in on my scooter
Uh you know just round London
Oh Id

I love my hometown as much as Motown I love SoCal
And you know I love Springsteen faded blue jeans Tennessee whiskey
But something happened I heard him laughing
I saw the dimples first and then I heard the accent
They say home is where the heart is
But thats not where mine lives
You know I love a London boy
I enjoy walking Camden Market in the afternoon
He likes my American smile like a child when our eyes meet
Darling I fancy you
Took me back to Highgate met all of his best mates
So I guess all the rumors are true
You know I love a London boy
Boy I fancy you Ooh

And now I love high tea stories from Uni and the West End
You can find me in the pub we are watching rugby with his school friends
Show me a gray sky a rainy cab ride
Babes dont threaten me with a good time
They say home is where the heart is
But God I love the English

You know I love a London boy I enjoy nights in Brixton
Shoreditch in the afternoon
He likes my American smile like a child when our eyes meet

The buttons of my coat were tangled in my hair
In doctors office lighting I didnt tell you I was scared

Holy orange bottles each night I pray to you
Desperate people find faith so now I pray to Jesus too
And I say to you

Ooh-ah
Soon youll get better
Ooh-ah
Soon youll get better
Ooh-ah
Youll get better soon
Cause you have to
I know delusion when I see it in the mirror
You like the nicer nurses you make the best of a bad deal

I know Ill never get it theres not a day that I wont try
And I say to you

Ooh-ah
Soon youll get better

Ooh-ah

Cause you have to

And I hate to make this all about me
But who am I supposed to talk to

We were crazy to think
Crazy to think that this could work
Remember how I said Id die for you
We were stupid to jump
In the ocean separating us
Remember how I’d fly to you

And I cant talk to you when youre like this
Staring out the window like I’m not your favorite town
Im New York City
I still do it for you babe
They all warned us about times like this
They say the road gets hard and you get lost
When youre led by blind faith blind faith
But we might just get away with it
Religions in your lips
Even if its a false god
Wed still worship
We might just get away with it
The altar is my hips
Even if its a false god
Wed still worship this love
We’d still worship this love
We’d still worship this love

I know heavens a thing
I go there when you touch me honey
Hell is when I fight with you
But we can patch it up good
Make confessions and we’re begging for forgiveness
Got the wine for you

And you cant talk to me when Im like this
Daring you to leave me just so I can try and scare you
Youre the West Village
You still do it for me babe
They all warned us about times like this
They say the road gets hard and you get lost
When you’re led by blind faith blind faith
But we might just get away with it
Religions in your lips
Even if its a false god
Wed still worship
We might just get away with it
The altar is my hips
Even if its a false god
Wed still worship this love
Wed still worship this love
Wed still worship this love ah

Still worship this love
Even if its a false god
Even if its a false god
You are somebody that I dont know
But youre takin shots at me like its Patrón
And Im just like damn its 7 AM
Say it in the street thats a knock-out
But you say it in a Tweet thats a cop-out
And Im just like Hey are you okay

And I aint tryna mess with your self-expression
But Ive learned a lesson that stressin and obsessin bout somebody else is no fun
And snakes and stones never broke my bones
So oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh
You need to calm down youre being too loud
And Im just like oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh Oh
You need to just stop like can you just not step on my gown
You need to calm down

You are somebody that we dont know
But youre comin at my friends like a missile
Why are you mad when you could be GLAAD You could be GLAAD
Sunshine on the street at the parade
But you would rather be in the dark ages
Makin that sign mustve taken all night

You just need to take several seats and then try to restore the peace
And control your urges to scream about all the people you hate
Cause shade never made anybody less gay

So oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh
You need to calm down youre being too loud
And Im just like oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh Oh
You need to just stop like can you just not step on his gown
You need to calm down
And we see you over there on the internet
Comparing all the girls who are killing it
But we figured you out
We all know now we all got crowns
You need to calm down

Oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh
You need to calm down You need to calm down
Youre being too loud Youre being too loud
And Im just like oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh Oh
You need to just stop Can you stop
Like can you just not step on our gowns
I blew things out of proportion now youre blue
Put you in jail for something you didn’t do
I pinned your hands behind your back oh
Thought I had reason to attack but no

Fighting with a true love is boxing with no gloves
Chemistry til it blows up til there’s no us
Whyd I have to break what I love so much
Its on your face and Im to blame I need to say
Hey its all me in my head
Im the one who burned us down
But its not what I meant
Sorry that I hurt you
I dont wanna do I don’t wanna do this to you Ooh
I don’t wanna lose I dont wanna lose this with you Ooh
I need to say hey it’s all me just dont go
Meet me in the afterglow

Its so excruciating to see you low
Just wanna lift you up and not let you go
This ultraviolet morning light below
Tells me this love is worth the fight oh

I lived like an island punished you with silence
Went off like sirens just crying
Whyd I have to break what I love so much
It’s on your face dont walk away I need to say

Hey its all me in my head
Im the one who burned us down
But its not what I meant
Im sorry that I hurt you
I dont wanna do I dont wanna do this to you Ooh
I dont wanna lose I dont wanna lose this with you Ooh
I need to say hey its all me just dont go
Meet me in the afterglow
Tell me that youre still mine
Tell me that well be just fine
Even when I lose my mind

Tell me that its not my fault
Tell me that Im all you want
Even when I break your heart
I need to say

Hey its all me in my head

But its not what I meant
Sorry that I hurt you
I dont wanna do I dont wanna do this to you Ooh
I dont wanna lose I dont wanna lose this with you Ooh

Video games you pass me a note
Sleeping in tents

Light pink sky up on the roof
Sun sinks down no curfew
20 questions we tell the truth
Youve been stressed out lately yeah me too
Something gave you the nerve
To touch my hand

Church bells ring carry me home
Rice on the ground looks like snow
Call my bluff call you Babe
Have my back yeah every day
Feels like home stay in bed
The whole weekend
Its nice to have a friend Ooh
Its nice to have a friend Ooh
Its nice to have a friend Ooh
My love was as cruel as the cities I lived in
Everyone looked worse in the light
There are so many lines that Ive crossed unforgiven
Ill tell you the truth but never goodbye

I dont wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
I dont wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
Ive been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night
And now I see daylight I only see daylight
Luck of the draw only draws the unlucky
And so I became the butt of the joke
I wounded the good and I trusted the wicked
Clearing the air I breathed in the smoke
Maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down
Maybe Ive stormed out of every single room in this town
Threw out our cloaks and our daggers because its morning now
Its brighter now now

I dont wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
I can never look away
I dont wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
Things will never be the same
Ive been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night
Now Im wide awake
And now I see daylight Daylight I only see daylight Daylight
I only see daylight daylight daylight daylight
I only see daylight daylight daylight daylight

And I can still see it all In my mind
All of you all of me Intertwined
I once believed love would be Black and white
But its golden Golden
And I can still see it all In my head
Back and forth from New York Sneaking in your bed
I once believed love would be Burning red
But its golden
Like daylight like daylight
Like daylight daylight
I dont wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
I can never look away
And I dont wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
Things will never be the same
Ive been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night
Now Im wide awake
And now I see daylight I see daylight I only see daylight Ah
I only see daylight daylight daylight daylight
I only see daylight daylight daylight daylight Ah
And I can still see it all
I only see daylight daylight daylight daylight
And I can still see it all back and forth from New York
I only see daylight daylight daylight daylight
I once believed love would be burning red

Like daylight
Its golden like daylight
You gotta step into the daylight and let it go
Just let it go let it go
I wanna be defined by the things that I love
Not the things I hate
Not the things Im afraid of Im afraid of
Or the things that haunt me in the middle of the night
I I just think that
Meet me at midnight

Staring at the ceiling with you
Oh you dont ever say too much
And you dont really read into
My melancholia

I been under scrutiny Yeah oh yeah
You handle it beautifully Yeah oh yeah
All this shit is new to me Yeah oh yeah
I feel the lavender haze creeping up on me
Surreal
Im damned if I do give a damn what people say
No deal
The 1950s shit they want from me
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze

All they keep asking me All they keep asking me
Is if Im gonna be your bride
The only kinda girl they see Only kinda girl they see
Is a one-night or a wife

I find it dizzying Yeah oh yeah
Theyre bringing up my history Yeah oh yeah
But you werent even listening Yeah oh yeah

I feel the lavender haze creepin up on me
Surreal
Im damned if I do give a damn what people say
No deal
The 1950s shit they want from me
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze
That lavender haze

Talk your talk and go viral

No deal No deal
The 1950s shit they want from me
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze

Get it off your chest
Get it off my desk
That lavender haze
I just wanna stay
When the morning came
We were cleaning incense off your vinyl shelf
Cause we lost track of time again
Laughing with my feet in your lap
Like you were my closest friend
Howd we end up on the floor anyway you say
Your roommates cheap-ass screw-top rosé thats how
I see you every day now

And I chose you
The one I was dancing with
In New York no shoes
Looked up at the sky and it was
The burgundy on my t-shirt
When you splashed your wine into me
And how the blood rushed into my cheeks
So scarlet it was
The mark thеy saw on my collarbone
The rust that grew bеtween telephones
The lips I used to call home
So scarlet it was maroon
When the silence came
We were shaking blind and hazy
How the hell did we lose sight of us again
Sobbing with your head in your hands
Aint that the way shit always ends
You were standing hollow-eyed in the hallway
Carnations you had thought were roses thats us
I feel you no matter what
The rubies that I gave up

And I lost you
The one I was dancing with
In New York no shoes
Looked up at the sky and it was Maroon
The burgundy on my t-shirt
When you splashed your wine into me
And how the blood rushed into my cheeks
So scarlet it was Maroon
The mark they saw on my collarbone
The rust that grew between telephones
The lips I used to call home
So scarlet it was maroon

And I wake with your memory over me
Thats a real fucking legacy legacy It was maroon
And I wake with your memory over me
Thats a real fucking legacy to leave
The burgundy on my t-shirt
When you splashed your wine into me
And how the blood rushed into my cheeks
So scarlet it was maroon
The mark they saw on my collarbone
The rust that grew between telephones
The lips I used to call home
So scarlet it was maroon

It was maroon
I have this thing where I get older but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift all of the people
Ive ghosted stand there in the room

I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
Tale as old as time
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day Ill watch as youre leaving
Cause you got tired of my scheming
For the last time
Its me hi
Im the problem its me
At teatime everybody agrees
Ill stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

Sometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And Im a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart but never killed

Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism
Like some kind of congressman
A tale as old as time
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day Ill watch as youre leaving
And life will lose all its meaning
For the last time

Its me hi
Im the problem its me Im the problem its me
At teatime everybody agrees
Ill stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero
I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money
She thinks I left them in the will
The family gathers round and reads it
And then someone screams out
Shes laughing up at us from hell

Its me hi
Im the problem its me
Its me hi
Im the problem its me
Its me hi
Everybody agrees everybody agrees

Its me hi Hi
Im the problem its me Im the problem its me
At teatime Teatime everybody agrees Everybody agrees
Ill stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
One night a few moons ago
I saw flecks of what couldve been lights
But it might just have been you
Passing by unbeknownst to me
Life is emotionally abusive
And time cant stop me quite like you did
And my flight was awful thanks for asking
Im unglued thanks to you

And its like snow at the beach
Weird but fuckin beautiful
Flying in a dream
Stars by the pocketful
You wanting me
Tonight feels impossible
But its comin down
No sound its all around
Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach
Like snow ah

This scene feels like what I once saw on a screen
I searched aurora borealis green
Ive never seen someone lit from within
Blurring out my periphery
My smile is like I won a contest
And to hide that would be so dishonest
And its fine to fake it til you make it
Til you do til its true

Now its like snow at the beach
Weird but fuckin beautiful
Flying in a dream
Stars by the pocketful
You wanting me
Tonight feels impossible
But its comin down
No sound its all around
Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach
Like snow ah

I I cant Cant speak afraid to jinx it
I I dont Dont even dare to wish it
But your eyes are flying saucers from another planet
Now Im all for you like Janet
Can this be a real thing Can it

Are we falling like snow at the beach Snow at the beach
Weird but fuckin beautiful
Flying in a dream Flying in a dream
Stars by the pocketful
You wanting me You wanting me
Tonight feels impossible
But its comin down
No sound its all around

Like snow on the beach Snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach Flying in a dream
Like snow on the beach You wanting me
Like snow ah
But its comin down
No sound its all around
Like snow on the beach
Its comin down its comin down
Its comin down its comin down
Like snow on the beach
Its comin down its comin down
Its comin down its comin down
Its comin down its comin down
Its comin down its comin down
Its comin down its comin down
Summer went away still the yearning stays
I play it cool with the best of them
I wait patiently hes gonna notice me
Its okay were the best of friends
Anyway
I hear it in your voice youre smoking with your boys
I touch my phone as if its your face
I didnt choose this town I dream of getting out
Theres just one who could make me stay
All my days
From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I waited ages to see you there
I search the party of better bodies
Just to learn that you never cared

Youre on your own kid
You always have been

I see the great escape so long Daisy May
I picked the petals he loves me not
Something different bloomed writing in my room
I play my songs in the parking lot
Ill run away

From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I called a taxi to take me there
I search the party of better bodies
Just to learn that my dreams arent rare

Youre on your own kid
You always have been

From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I gave my blood sweat and tears for this
I hosted parties and starved my body
Like Id be saved by a perfect kiss
The jokes werent funny I took the money
My friends from home dont know what to say
I looked around in a blood-soaked gown
And I saw something they cant take away
Cause there were pages turned with the bridges burned
Everything you lose is a step you take
So make the friendship bracelets take the moment and taste it
Youve got no reason to be afraid

Youre on your own kid
Yeah you can face this
Youre on your own kid
Rain
He wanted it comfortable I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride I was making my own name
Chasing that fame he stayed the same
All of me changed like midnight

My town was a wasteland
Full of cages full of fences
Pageant queens and big pretenders
But for some it was paradise
My boy was a montage
A slow-motion love potion
Jumping off things in the ocean
I broke his heart cause he was nice
He was sunshine I was midnight rain
He wanted it comfortable I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride I was making my own name
Chasing that fame he stayed the same
All of me changed like midnight

It came like a postcard
Picture perfect shiny family
Holiday peppermint candy
But for him its every day
So I peered through a window
A deep portal time travel
All the love we unravel
And the life I gave away
Cause he was sunshine I was midnight rain

He wanted it comfortable I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride I was making my own name
Chasing that fame he stayed the same
All of me changed like midnight rain
He wanted it comfortable I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride I was making my own name
Chasing that fame he stayed the same
All of me changed like midnight
I guess sometimes we all get
Just what we wanted just what we wanted
And he never thinks of me
Except for when Im on TV
I guess sometimes we all get
Some kind of haunted some kind of haunted
And I never think of him
Except on midnights like this
I remember

Good girl sad boy
Big city wrong choices
We had one thing goin on
I swear that it was somethin
Cause I dont remember who I was
Before you painted all my nights
A color Ive searched for since
But one thing after another
Fuckin situations circumstances
Miscommunications and I
Have to say by the way
I just may like some explanations
Can I ask you a question
Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room
And every single one of your friends was makin fun of you
But fifteen seconds later thеy were clappin too
Then what did you do
Did you lеave her house in the middle of the night Oh
Did you wish youd put up more of a fight oh
When she said it was too much
Do you wish you could still touch her
Its just a question

Half-moon eyes bad surprise
Did you realize out of time
She was on your mind with some dickhead guy
That you saw that night
But you were on somethin
It was one drink after another
Fuckin politics and gender roles
And youre not sure and I dont know
Got swept away in the gray
I just may like to have a conversation

Can I ask you a question
Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room
And every single one of your friends was makin fun of you
But fifteen seconds later they were clappin too
Then what did you do
Did you leave her house in the middle of the night Oh
Did you wish youd put up more of a fight oh
When she said it was too much
Do you wish you could still touch her
Its just a question
Does it feel like everythings just like
Second best after that meteor strike
And whats that that I heard That youre still with her
Thats nice Im sure thats whats suitable
And right but tonight

Can I ask you a question Can I ask you a question
Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room In a crowded room
And every single one of your friends was makin fun of you Makin fun of you
But fifteen seconds later they were clappin too
Then what did you do Do
Did you leave her house in the middle of the night Oh
Did you wish youd put up more of a fight oh More of a fight
When she said it was too much
Do you wish you could still touch her
Draw the cat eye sharp enough to kill a man
You did some bad things but Im the worst of them
Sometimes I wonder which onell be your last lie
They say looks can kill and I might try
I dont dress for women
I dont dress for men
Lately Ive been dressin for revenge

I dont start shit but I can tell you how it ends
Dont get sad get even
So on the weekends
I dont dress for friends
Lately Ive been dressin for revenge
She needed cold hard proof so I gave her some
She had the envelope where you think she got it from
Now she gets the house gets the kids gets the pride
Picture me thick as thieves with your ex-wife
And she looks so pretty
Drivin in your Benz
Lately shes been dressin for revenge

She dont start shit but she can tell you how it ends
Dont get sad get even
So on the weekends
She dont dress for friends
Lately shes been dressing for revenge

Ladies always rise above
Ladies know what people want
Someone sweet and kind and fun
The lady simply had enough

While he was doin lines and crossin all of mine
Someone told his white-collar crimes to the FBI
And I dont dress for villains
Or for innocents
Im on my vigilante shit again
I dont start shit but I can tell you how it ends
Dont get sad get even
So on the weekends
I dont dress for friends
Baby love I think Ive been a little too kind
Didnt notice you walkin all over my peace of mind
In the shoes I gave you as a present
Puttin someone first only works when youre in their top five
And by the way Im goin out tonight

Best believe Im still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer
And when I meet the band
They ask Do you have a man
I could still say I dont remember
Familiarity breeds contempt
Dont put mе in the basement
Whеn I want the penthouse of your heart
Diamonds in my eyes
I polish up real I polish up real nice
Nice

Baby boy I think Ive been too good of a girl Too good of a girl
Did all the extra credit then got graded on a curve
I think its time to teach some lessons
I made you my world Huh have you heard Huh
I can reclaim the land
And I miss you Miss you
But I miss sparklin Nice

Best believe Im still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer
And when I meet the band
They ask Do you have a man
I could still say I dont remember
Familiarity breeds contempt
Dont put me in the basement
When I want the penthouse of your heart
Diamonds in my eyes
I polish up real I polish up real nice

Nice
Sapphire tears on my face
Sadness became my whole sky
But some guy said my auras moonstone
Just cause he was high
And were dancin all night
And you can try to change my mind
But you might have to wait in line
Whats a girl gonna do
A diamonds gotta shine

Best believe Im still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer Shimmer
And when I meet the band
They ask Do you have a man
I could still say I dont remember
Familiarity breeds contempt
Dont put me in the basement
When I want the penthouse of your heart
Diamonds in my eyes
I polish up real Nice I polish up real nice

And were dancin all night
And you can try to change my mind
But you might have to wait in line
Whats a girl gonna do Whats a girl gonna do
I polish up nice
Best believe Im still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
It only hurts this much right now
Was what I was thinkin the whole time
Breathe in breathe through breathe deep breathe out
Ill be gettin over you my whole life

You know how scared I am of elevators
Never trust it if it rises fast
It cant last
Uh-oh Im fallin in love
Oh no Im fallin in love again
Oh Im fallin in love
I thought the plane was goin down
Howd you turn it right around

It only feels this raw right now
Lost in the labyrinth of my mind
Break up break free break through break down
You would break your back to make me break a smile

You know how much I hate
That everybody just expects me to bounce back
Just like that

Uh-oh Im fallin in love
Oh no Im fallin in love again
Oh Im fallin in love
I thought the plane was goin down
Howd you turn it right around
Uh-oh Im fallin in love
Oh no Im fallin in love again
Oh Im fallin in love
I thought the plane was goin down
Howd you turn it right around
Uh-oh Im fallin in love
Oh no Im fallin in love again
Oh Im fallin in love
I thought the plane was goin down
Howd you turn it right around
Uh-oh Im fallin in love
Oh no Im fallin in love again
Oh Im fallin in love
I thought the plane was goin down
Youre talking shit for the hell of it
Addicted to betrayal but youre relevant
Youre terrified to look down
Cause if you dare youll see the glare
Of everyone you burned just to get there
Its coming back around

And I keep my side of the street clean
You wouldnt know what I mean
Cause karma is my boyfriend
Karma is a god
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend
Karmas a relaxing thought
Arent you envious that for you its not
Sweet like honey karma is a cat
Purring in my lap cause it loves me
Flexing like a goddamn acrobat
Me and karma vibe like that

Spiderboy king of thieves
Weave your little webs of opacity
My pennies made your crown
Trick me once trick me twice
Dont you know that cash aint the only price
Its coming back around

And I keep my side of the street clean
You wouldnt know what I mean

Cause karma is my boyfriend
Karma is a god
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend
Karmas a relaxing thought
Arent you envious that for you its not
Sweet like honey karma is a cat
Purring in my lap cause it loves me
Flexing like a goddamn acrobat
Me and karma vibe like that
Ask me what I learned from all those years
Ask me what I earned from all those tears
Ask me why so many fade but Im still here
Im still here Im still here

Cause karma is the thunder
Rattling your ground
Karmas on your scent like a bounty hunter
Karmas gonna track you down
Step by step from town to town
Sweet like justice karma is a queen
Karma takes all my friends to the summit
Karma is the guy on the screen
Coming straight home to me

Cause karma is my boyfriend Karma is my boyfriend
Karma is a god
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend Weekend
Karmas a relaxing thought
Arent you envious that for you its not
Sweet like honey karma is a cat
Purring in my lap cause it loves me
Flexing like a goddamn acrobat
Me and karma vibe like that
Karma is my boyfriend
Karma is a god Ah
Uh-huh mm
I spy with my little tired eye
Tiny as a firefly
A pebble that we picked up last July
Down deep inside your pocket
We almost forgot it
Does it ever miss Wicklow sometimes
Ooh ooh

They said the end is comin
Everyone’s up to somethin
I find myself runnin home to your sweet nothings
Outside they’re push and shovin
Youre in the kitchen hummin
All that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothin
On the way home
I wrote a poem
You say What a mind
This happens all the time
Ooh ooh

Causе they said the end is comin
Evеryones up to somethin’
I find myself runnin’ home to your sweet nothings
Outside theyre push and shovin’
Youre in the kitchen hummin
All that you ever wanted from me was nothin

Industry disruptors and soul deconstructors
And smooth-talking hucksters out glad-handing each other
And the voices that implore You should be doing more
To you I can admit that I’m just too soft for all of it
Ooh

They said the end is comin
Everyones up to somethin
I find myself runnin home to your sweet nothings
Outside theyre push and shovin
Youre in the kitchen hummin
All that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothin
They said the end is comin They said the end is comin
Everyones up to somethin Everyones up to somethin
I find myself runnin home to your sweet nothings
Outside theyre push and shovin Outside theyre push and shovin
Youre in the kitchen hummin Youre in the kitchen hummin
Once upon a time the planets and the fates
And all the stars aligned
You and I ended up in the same room
At the same time

And the touch of a hand lit the fuse
Of a chain reaction of countermoves
To assess the equation of you
Checkmate I couldnt lose
What if I told you none of it was accidental
And the first night that you saw me
Nothing was gonna stop me
I laid the groundwork and then
Just like clockwork
The dominoes cascaded in a line
What if I told you Im a mastermind
And now youre mine
It was all by dеsign
Cause Im a mastermind

You see all the wisеst women
Had to do it this way
Cause we were born to be the pawn
In every lovers game

If you fail to plan you plan to fail
Strategy sets the scene for the tale
Im the wind in our free-flowing sails
And the liquor in our cocktails

What if I told you none of it was accidental
And the first night that you saw me
I knew I wanted your body
I laid the groundwork and then
Just like clockwork
The dominoes cascaded in a line
What if I told you Im a mastermind
And now youre mine
It was all my design
Cause Im a mastermind
No one wanted to play with me as a little kid
So Ive been scheming like a criminal ever since
To make them love me and make it seem effortless
This is the first time Ive felt the need to confess
And I swear
Im only cryptic and Machiavellian
Cause I care

So I told you none of it was accidental
And the first night that you saw me
Nothing was gonna stop me
I laid the groundwork and then
Saw a wide smirk on your face
You knew the entire time
You knew that Im a mastermind
And now youre mine
Yeah all you did was smile
My knuckles were bruised like violets
Sucker punching walls cursed you as I sleep-talked
Spineless in my tomb of silence
Tore your banners down took the battle underground
And maybe it was egos swinging
Maybe it was her
Flashes of the battle come back to me in a blur

All that bloodshed crimson clover
Uh-huh sweet dream was over
My hand was the one you reached for
All throughout the Great War
Always remember
Uh-huh tears on the lеtter
I vowed not to cry anymore
If wе survived the Great War
You drew up some good faith treaties
I drew curtains closed drank my poison all alone
You said I have to trust more freely
But diesel is desire you were playing with fire
And maybe its the past thats talking
Screaming from the crypt
Telling me to punish you for things you never did
So I justified it

All that bloodshed crimson clover
Uh-huh the bombs were closer
My hand was the one you reached for
All throughout the Great War
Always remember
Uh-huh the burning embers
I vowed not to fight anymore
If we survived the Great War

Uh-huh uh-huh

It turned into something bigger
Somewhere in the haze got a sense Id been betrayed
Your finger on my hairpin triggers
Soldier down on that icy ground
Looked up at me with honor and truth
Broken and blue so I called off the troops
That was the night I nearly lost you
I really thought Id lost you
We can plant a memory garden
Say a solemn prayer place a poppy in my hair
Theres no morning glory it was war it wasnt fair
And we will never go back

To that bloodshed crimson clover
Uh-huh the worst was over
My hand was the one you reached for
All throughout the Great War
Always remember
Uh-huh were burned for better
I vowed I would always be yours
Cause we survived the Great War

Uh-huh uh-huh
I will always be yours
Cause we survived the Great War
Uh-huh
No words appear before me in the aftermath
Salt streams out my eyes and into my ears
Every single thing I touch becomes sick with sadness
Cause its all over now all out to sea

Goodbye goodbye goodbye
You were bigger than the whole sky
You were more than just a short time
And Ive got a lot to pine about
Ive got a lot to live without
Im never gonna meet
What couldve been wouldve been
What shouldve been you
What couldve been wouldve been you
Did some bird flap its wings ovеr in Asia
Did some force take you bеcause I didnt pray
Every single thing to come has turned into ashes
Cause its all over its not meant to be
So Ill say words I dont believe

Goodbye goodbye goodbye
You were bigger than the whole sky
You were more than just a short time
And Ive got a lot to pine about
Ive got a lot to live without
Im never gonna meet
What couldve been wouldve been
What shouldve been you

What couldve been wouldve been you
What couldve been wouldve been
What shouldve been you
What couldve been wouldve been you
What couldve been wouldve been you

Goodbye goodbye goodbye
You were bigger than the whole sky
You were more than just a short time
And Ive got a lot to pine about
Ive got a lot to live without
Im never gonna meet
What couldve been wouldve been
Your ex-friends sister
Met someone at a club and he kissed her
Turns out it was that guy you hooked up with ages ago
Some wannabe Z-lister
And all the outfits were terrible
2003 unbearable
Did you see the photos
No I didnt but thanks though

Im so in love that I might stop breathing
Drew a map on your bedroom ceiling
No I didnt see the news
Cause we were somewhere else
Stumbled down pretend alleyways
Cheap wine make believe its champagne
I was taken by the view
Like we were in Paris
Like we were somewhere else
Like we were in Paris oh
We were somewhere else

Privacy sign on the door
And on my page and on the whole world
Romance is not dead if you keep it just yours
Levitate above all the messes made
Sit quiet by my side in the shade
And not the kind thats thrown
I mean the kind under where a tree has grown

Im so in love that I might stop breathing
Drew a map on your bedroom ceiling
No I didnt see the news
Cause we were somewhere else
Stumbled down pretend alleyways
Cheap wine make believe its champagne
I was taken by the view

Like we were in Paris oh
Like we were somewhere else
Like we were in Paris oh
We were somewhere else
I wanna brainwash you
Into loving me forever
I wanna transport you
To somewhere the cultures clever
Confess my truth
In swooping sloping cursive letters
Let the only flashing lights be the tower at midnight
In my mind

We drew a map on your bedroom ceiling
No I didnt see the news
Cause we were somewhere else
In an alleyway drinking champagne

Cause we were in Paris
Yes we were somewhere else
My love we were in Paris
Lock broken slur spoken
Wound open game token
I didnt know you were keeping count
Rain soaking blind hoping
You said I was freeloading
I didnt know you were keeping count

High infidelity
Put on your records and regret me
I bent the truth too far tonight
I was dancing around dancing around it
High infidelity
Put on your headphones and burn my city
Your picket fence is sharp as knives
I was dancing around dancing around it
Do you really wanna know where I was April 29th
Do I really have to chart the constellations in his eyes

Storm coming good husband
Bad omen
Dragged my feet right down the aisle
At the house lonely good money
Id pay if youd just know me
Seemed like the right thing at the time

You know theres many different ways that you can kill the one you love
The slowest way is never loving them enough
Do you really wanna know where I was April 29th
Do I really have to tell you how he brought me back to life

High infidelity
Put on your records and regret me
I bent the truth too far tonight
I was dancing around dancing around it
High infidelity
Put on your headphones and burn my city
Your picket fence is sharp as knives
I was dancing around dancing around it
Do you really want to know where I was April 29th
Do I really have to chart the constellations in his eyes
You know theres many different ways that you can kill the one you love
The slowest way is never loving them enough

High infidelity
Put on your records and regret meeting me
I bent the truth too far tonight
I was dancing around dancing around it
High infidelity
Put on your headphones and burn my city
Your picket fence is sharp as knives
I was dancing around dancing around it


Oh theres many different ways that you can kill the one you love
And its never enough its never enough

Lock broken slur spoken
Wound open game token
I didnt know you were keeping count
Rain soaking blind hoping
You said I was freeloading
I didnt know you were keeping count
We were supposed to be just friends
You dont live in my part of town but maybe Ill see you out some weekend
Depending on what kind of mood and situationship Im in
And whats in my system

I think theres been a glitch oh yeah
Five seconds later Im fastening myself to you with a stitch oh yeah
And Im not even sorry nights are so starry
Blood moonlit
It must be counterfeit
I think theres been a glitch oh yeah
I was supposed to sweat you out
In search of glorious happenings of happenstance on someone elses playground
But its been two-thousand one-hundred ninety days of our love blackout
Our love is blacking out
The systems breaking down
The systems breaking down

I think theres been a glitch oh yeah
Five seconds later Im fastening myself to you with a stitch oh yeah
And Im not even sorry nights are so starry
Blood moonlit
It must be counterfeit
I think theres been a glitch

A brief interruption a slight malfunction
Id go back to wanting dudes who give nothing
I thought we had no chance
And thats romance lets dance

Glitch oh yeah
Five seconds later Im fastening myself to you with a stitch oh yeah
And Im not even sorry nights are so starry
Blood moonlit
It must be counterfeit It must be counterfeit
If you wouldve blinked then I wouldve
Looked away at the first glance
If you tasted poison you couldve
Spit me out at the first chance
And if I was some paint did it splatter
On a promising grown man
And if I was a child did it matter
If you got to wash your hands

Ooh all I used to do was pray
Wouldve couldve shouldve
If youd never looked my way
I wouldve stayed on my knees
And I damn sure never wouldve danced with the devil
At nineteen
And the Gods honest truth is that the pain was heaven
And now that Im grown Im scared of ghosts
Memories feel like weapons
And now that I know I wish youd left me wondering

If you never touched me I wouldve
Gone along with the righteous
If I never blushed then they couldve
Never whispered about this
And if you never saved me from boredom
I couldve gone on as I was
But Lord you made me feel important
And then you tried to erase us

Ooh youre a crisis of my faith
Wouldve couldve shouldve
If Id only played it safe

I wouldve stayed on my knees
And I damn sure never wouldve danced with the devil
At nineteen
And the Gods honest truth is that the pain was heaven
And now that Im grown Im scared of ghosts
Memories feel like weapons
And now that I know I wish youd left me wondering
God rest my soul
I miss who I used to be
The tomb wont close
Stained glass windows in my mind
I regret you all the time
I cant let this go
I fight with you in my sleep
The wound wont close
I keep on waiting for a sign
I regret you all the time

If claritys in death then why wont this die
Years of tearing down our banners you and I
Living for the thrill of hitting you where it hurts
Give me back my girlhood it was mine first

And I damn sure never wouldve danced with the devil
At nineteen
And the Gods honest truth is that the pain was heaven
And now that Im grown Im scared of ghosts
Memories feel like weapons
And now that I know I wish youd left me wondering
God rest my soul
I miss who I used to be
The tomb wont close
Stained glass windows in my mind
I regret you all the time
I cant let this go
I fight with you in my sleep
The wound wont close
I keep on waiting for a sign
I regret you all the time
Oh God rest my soul
I miss who I used to be
The tomb wont close
Stained glass windows in my mind
I regret you all the time
I cant let this go
I fight with you in my sleep
The wound wont close
I keep on waiting for a sign
Dear reader if it feels like a trap
Youre already in one
Dear reader get out your map
Pick somewhere and just run
Dear reader burn all the files
Desert all your past lives
And if you dont recognize yourself
That means you did it right

Never take advice from someone whos falling apart
Never take advice from someone whos falling apart You should find another
Dear reader bend when you can
Snap when you have to
Dear reader you dont have to answer
Just cause they asked you
You should find another
Dear reader the greatest of luxuries is your secrets
Dear reader when you aim at the devil
Make sure you dont miss

Never take advice from someone whos falling apart
Never take advice from someone whos falling apart

So I wander through these nights
I prefer hiding in plain sight
My fourth drink in my hand
These desperate prayers of a cursed man
Spilling out to you for free
But darling darling please
You wouldnt take my word for it if you knew who was talking
If you knew where I was walking
To a house not a home all alone cause nobodys there
Where I pace in my pen and my friends found friends who care
No one sees when you lose when youre playing solitaire
You should find another guiding light guiding light
But I shine so bright
You should find another guiding light guiding light
But I shine so bright
You should find another you should find another Guiding light
Find another you should find another
Im walking fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love til it hurts or bleeds
Or fades in time

And I never Never
Saw you coming
And I’ll never Never
Be the same
You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannonball
Now all we know is don’t let go
We are alone just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs four blue eyes

So you were never a saint
And Ive loved in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild

And I never Never
Saw you coming
And I’ll never Never
Be the same

This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
You’re my Achilles heel
This is the golden age
Of something good and right and real
And I never Never
Saw you coming
And I’ll never
Be the same

And I never Never
Saw you coming
And I’ll never So you were never a saint
And Ive loved in shades of wrong
Be the same We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild

This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
Faster than the wind passionate as sin ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind once youre already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn so bright just before they lose it all

Losing him was blue like Id never known
Missing him was dark gray all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody youve never met
But loving him was red
Red red
Red red
Loving him was red
Red red
Red red

Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing theres no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong

Losing him was blue like Id never known
Missing him was dark gray all alone Whoa
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody youve never met
But loving him was red

Red red
Oh red Red red
Burning red Red red
Red red

Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself its time now gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
In burning red
Burning it was red
Oh losing him was blue like Id never known
Missing him was dark gray all alone Whoa
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody youve never met
Cause loving him was red

Red red Yeah yeah red Red red
Burning red Red red
Red red

And thats why Red red hes spinning round in my head
Comes back to me Red red burning red
Red red Yeah yeah
Red red

Put your lips close to mine
As long as they dont touch
Out of focus eye to eye
Til the gravitys too much
And Ill do anything you say
If you say it with your hands
And Id be smart to walk away
But youre quicksand

This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
And I-I-I like it
I cant decide if its a choice
Getting swept away
I hear the sound of my own voice
Asking you to stay
And all we are is skin and bone
Trained to get along
Forever going with the flow
But youre friction

This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
I I I like it

Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will get you get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive
And I would follow you follow you home
Ill follow you follow you home

This hope is treacherous
This daydream is dangerous
This hope is treacherous
I-I-I I-I-I I-I-I
Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will get you get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive
And I would follow you follow you home
Ill follow you follow you home
Ill follow you follow you home
Ill follow you follow you home

This slope is treacherous

Once upon a time a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights you got me alone
You found me you found me
You found me-e-e-e-e
I guess you didnt care and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard you took a step back
Without me without me
Without me-e-e-e-e
And hes long gone when hes next to me
And I realize the blame is on me

Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places Id never been
Til you put me down oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places Id never been
Now Im lying on the cold hard ground

Oh oh-oh
Trouble trouble trouble
Oh oh-oh
Trouble trouble trouble

No apologies hell never see you cry
Pretends he doesnt know that hes the reason why
Youre drowning youre drowning
Youre drowning-ing-ing-ing-ing
And I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all Ill ever be
And now I see now I see
Now I see-e-e-e-e
He was long gone when he met me
And I realize the joke is on me yeah

I knew you were trouble when you walked in Oh
So shame on me now
Flew me to places Id never been
Til you put me down oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places Id never been Yeah
Now Im lying on the cold hard ground

Oh oh-oh
Trouble trouble trouble Yeah trouble
Oh oh-oh
Trouble trouble trouble

And the saddest fear
Comes creeping in
That you never loved me
Or her or anyone or anything yeah
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places Id never been Never been
Til you put me down oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in Knew it right there
So shame on me now Knew it right there
Flew me to places Id never been Ooh
Now Im lying on the cold hard ground

Oh oh-oh
Trouble trouble trouble Oh
Oh oh-oh
Trouble trouble trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble trouble trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble trouble trouble
I walked through the door with you the air was cold
But something bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sisters house
And youve still got it in your drawer even now

Oh your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
Were singing in the car getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days
And I know its long gone and
That magics not here no more
And I might be okay but Im not fine at all
Oh oh oh

Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red cause you were lookin over at me
Wind in my hair I was there
I remember it all too well

Photo album on the counter your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mothers telling stories bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me bout your past thinking your future was me

And I know its long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to
Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
Were dancing ‘round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs I was there
I remember it all too well yeah
Well maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
Til you tore it all up
Running scared I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again
Just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
Im a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
Cause I remember it all all all
Too well

Time wont fly its like Im paralyzed by it
Id like to be my old self again but Im still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You cant get rid of it
Cause you remember it all too well yeah

Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing youve ever known
It was rare I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs you were there
You remember it all
It was rare I was there
It feels like a perfect night
To dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes
Uh-uh uh-uh
It feels like a perfect night
For breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers
Uh-uh uh-uh

Yeah
Were happy free confused and lonely at the same time
Its miserable and magical oh yeah
Tonights the night when we forget about the deadlines
Its time oh-oh
I dont know about you
But Im feeling twenty-two
Everything will be alright if
You keep me next to you
You dont know about me
But Ill bet you want to
Everything will be alright if
We just keep dancing like were
Twenty-two twenty-two

It seems like one of those nights
This place is too crowded
Too many cool kids
Uh-uh uh-uh Whos Taylor Swift anyway Ew
It seems like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
And end up dreamin
Instead of sleeping

Yeah
Were happy free confused and lonely in the best way
Its miserable and magical oh yeah
Tonights the night when we forget about the heartbreaks
Its time oh-oh
Hey I dont know about you

I threw my phone across the room at you
I was expecting some dramatic turn away
But you stayed
This morning I said we should talk about it
Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved
Thats when you came in wearing a football helmet
And said Okay lets talk
And I said
Stay stay stay
Ive been loving you for quite some time time time
You think that its funny when Im mad mad mad
But I think that its best if we both stay

Before you Id only dated self-indulgent takers
Who took all of their problems out on me
But you carry my groceries and now Im always laughing
And I love you because you have given me
No choice but to

Stay stay stay
Ive been loving you for quite some time time time
You think that its funny when Im mad mad mad
But I think that its best if we both stay stay stay stay

You took the time to memorize me
My fears my hopes and dreams
I just like hanging out with you all the time
All those times that you didnt leave its been occurring to me
Id like to hang out with you for my whole life
Stay and Ill be loving you for quite some time
No one else is gonna love me when I get mad mad mad
So I think that its best if we both stay stay
Stay stay stay stay

Stay stay stay
Ive been loving you for quite some time time time
You think that its funny when Im mad mad mad
But I think that its best if we both stay stay
Stay stay stay stay

Stay stay stay
Ive been loving you for quite some time time time
You think that its funny when Im mad mad mad
But I think that its best if we both stay
Find myself at your door
Just like all those times before
I’m not sure how I got there
All roads they lead me here
I imagine you are home
In your room all alone
And you open your eyes into mine
And everything feels better

And right before your eyes
Im breaking no past
No reasons why
Just you and me
This is the last time Im asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time Im asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye Eye eye

You find yourself at my door
Just like all those times before
You wear your best apology
But I was there to watch you leave
And all the times I let you in
Just for you to go again
Disappear when you come back
Everything is better

And right before your eyes
Im aching run fast
Nowhere to hide
Just you and me

This is the last time Im asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time Im asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye Eye eye

This is the last time you tell me Ive got it wrong
This is the last time I say its been you all along
This is the last time I let you in my door
This is the last time I wont hurt you anymore
Oh-ho oh-ho oh-ho oh-ho
Oh-ho oh-ho oh-ho oh-ho
This is the last time Im asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time Im asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye

This is the last time Im asking you this This is the last time Im asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time Im asking you why This is the last time Im asking you why

This is the last time Im asking you last time Im asking you
Last time Im asking you this
This is the last time Im asking you last time Im asking you
I was reminiscing just the other day
While having coffee all alone and Lord it took me away
Back to a first-glance feeling on New York time
Back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme
Took off faster than a green light go
Hey you skip the conversation when you already know
I left a note on the door with a joke wed made
And that was the first day

And darling it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground
Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
We had this big wide city all to ourselves
We blocked the noise with the sound of I need you
And for the first time I had something to lose
And I guess we fell apart in the usual way
And the storys got dust on every page
But sometimes I wonder how you think about it now
And I see your face in every crowd

Cause darling it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

Tonight Im gonna dance
For all that weve been through
But I dont wanna dance
If Im not dancing with you
Tonight Im gonna dance
Like you were in this room
But I dont wanna dance
If Im not dancing with you
It was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

Tonight Im gonna dance
For all that weve been through
But I dont wanna dance
If Im not dancing with you
Tonight Im gonna dance
Like you were in this room
But I dont wanna dance
Long handwritten note deep in your pocket
Words how little they mean when youre a little too late
I stood right by the tracks your face in a locket
Good girls hopeful theyll be and long they will wait

We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair

In dreams I meet you in warm conversation
We both wake in lonely beds different cities
And time is taking its sweet time erasing you
And youve got your demons and darling they all look like me
Cause we had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair

Distance timing
Breakdown fighting
Silence the train runs off its tracks
Kiss me try to fix it
Could you just try to listen
Hang up give up
And for the life of us we cant get back

A beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic
Beautiful tragic beautiful

What we had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair
We had a beautiful magic love there
New to town with a made-up name
In the angels city chasing fortune and fame
And the camera flashes make it look like a dream
You had it figured out since you were in school
Everybody loves pretty everybody loves cool
So overnight you look like a sixties queen

Another name goes up in lights
Like diamonds in the sky
And they’ll tell you now you’re the lucky one
Yeah they’ll tell you now you’re the lucky one
But can you tell me now you’re the lucky one
Oh oh oh

Now it’s big black cars and Riviera views
And your lover in the foyer doesn’t even know you
And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page
And they tell you that you’re lucky but you’re so confused
Cause you don’t feel pretty you just feel used
And all the young things line up to take your place

Another name goes up in lights
You wonder if you’ll make it out alive

And they’ll tell you now you’re the lucky one
Yeah they’ll tell you now you’re the lucky one
But can you tell me now you’re the lucky one
Oh oh oh

It was a few years later I showed up here
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared
How you took the money and your dignity and got the hell out
They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere
Chose the rose garden over Madison Square
And it took some time but I understand it now
Cause now my name is up in lights
But I think you got it right

Let me tell you now you’re the lucky one
Let me tell you now you’re the lucky one
Let me tell you now you’re the lucky one oh oh oh
And they’ll tell you now you’re the lucky one
Yeah they’ll tell you now you’re the lucky one
And they’ll tell you now you’re the lucky one oh oh oh
You good to go

All I knew this morning when I woke
Is I know something now
Know something now I didnt before
And all Ive seen since 18 hours ago
Is green eyes and freckles and your smile
In the back of my mind making me feel like
I just wanna know you better
Know you better know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better know you better now
I just wanna know you know you know you

Cause all I know is we said Hello
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
And everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
Youll be mine and Ill be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

And all my walls stood tall painted blue
And Ill take em down take em down
And open up the door for you
And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies
The beautiful kind making up for lost time
Taking flight making me feel right
I just wanna know you better
Know you better know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better know you better now
I just wanna know you know you know you

Cause all I know is we said Hello
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
And everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
Youll be mine and Ill be yours
All I know since yesterday

Come back and tell me why
Im feeling like Ive missed you all this time
And meet me there tonight
And let me know that its not all in my mind
I just wanna know you better
Know you better know you better now
I just wanna know you know you know you
Cause all I know is we said Hello
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
And everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
Youll be mine and Ill be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

All I know is we said Hello
So dust off your highest hopes
All I know is pouring rain
And everything has changed
All I know is a new found grace
All my days Ill know your face
All I know since yesterday
I said Oh my what a marvelous tune
It was the best night never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing dancing
Like were made of starlight
Like were made of starlight

I met Bobby on the boardwalk summer of 45
Picked me up late one night at the window
We were 17 and crazy running wild wild
Cant remember what song it was playing when we walked in
The night we snuck into a yacht club party
Pretending to be a duchess and a prince
And I said Oh my what a marvelous tune
It was the best night never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing dancing
Like were made of starlight starlight
Like were made of starlight starlight

He said “Look at you worrying too much about things you cant change
Youll spend your whole life singing the blues if you keep thinking that way
He was trying to skip rocks on the ocean saying to me
Dont you see the starlight starlight
Dont you dream impossible things

Like Oh my what a marvelous tune
It was the best night never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing dancing
Like were made of starlight starlight
Like were made of starlight starlight

Ooh-ooh hes talking crazy
Ooh-ooh dancing with me
Ooh-ooh we could get married
Have ten kids and teach em how to dream

Oh my what a marvelous tune
It was the best night never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing dancing
Like were made of starlight starlight
Like were made of starlight starlight

Like were made of starlight starlight
Like we dream impossible dreams
Like starlight starlight
Like we dream impossible dreams

Dont you see the starlight starlight
Took a deep breath in the mirror
He didnt like it when I wore high heels
But I do
Turn the lock and put my headphones on
He always said he didnt get this song
But I do I do

I walked in expecting youd be late
But you got here early and you stand and wave
I walk to you
You pull my chair out and help me in
And you dont know how nice that is
But I do
And you throw your head back laughin like a little kid
I think its strange that you think Im funny cause he never did
Ive been spending the last eight months
Thinkin all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a café I watched it begin again

You said you never met one girl who
Had as many James Taylor records as you
But I do
We tell stories and you dont know why
Im comin off a little shy
But I do

But you throw your head back laughin like a little kid
I think its strange that you think Im funny cause he never did
Ive been spending the last eight months
Thinkin all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a café I watched it begin again

And we walked down the block to my car
And I almost brought him up
But you start to talk about the movies
That your family watches every single Christmas
And I wanna talk about that
And for the first time whats past is past
Cause you throw your head back laughin like a little kid
I think its strange that you think Im funny cause he never did
Ive been spending the last eight months
Thinkin all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a café I watched it begin again

Hmm hmm
You shouldve been there
Shouldve burst through the door
With that Baby Im right here smile
And it wouldve felt like
A million little shining stars had just aligned
And I wouldve been so happy

Christmas lights glisten
Ive got my eye on the door
Just waiting for you to walk in
But the time is ticking
People ask me how Ive been
As I comb back through my memory
How you said youd be here
You said youd be here
And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And theyre all laughing
As Im looking around the room
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew

And the hours pass by
Now I just wanna be alone
But your close friends always seem to know
When theres something really wrong
So they follow me down the hall
And there in the bathroom
I try not to fall apart
And the sinking feeling starts
As I say hopelessly
He said hed be here

And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And theyre all laughing
And asking me about you
But there was one thing missing Missing
And that was the moment I knew
What do you say
When tears are streaming down your face
In front of everyone you know
And what do you do
When the one who means the most to you
Is the one who didnt show

You shouldve been here
And I wouldve been so happy

And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And theyre all standing around me singing
Happy birthday to you
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh I knew
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

You called me later
And said Im sorry I didnt make it
And I said Im sorry too
You said it in a simple way
4 am the second day
How strange that I dont know you at all
Stumbled through the long goodbye
One last kiss then catch your flight
Right when I was just about to fall

I told myself dont get attached
But in my mind I play it back
Spinning faster than the plane that took you
And this is when the feeling sinks in
I dont wanna miss you like this
Come back be here come back be here
I guess youre in New York today
I dont wanna need you this way
Come back be here come back be here

The delicate beginning rush
The feeling you can know so much
Without knowing anything at all
And now that I can put this down
If I had known what I know now
I never wouldve played so nonchalant

Taxi cabs and busy streets
That never bring you back to me
I cant help but wish you took me with you

And this is when the feeling sinks in
I dont wanna miss you like this
Come back be here come back be here
I guess youre in London today
And I dont wanna need you this way
Come back be here come back be here
This is falling in love in the cruelest way
This is falling for you when you are worlds away
In New York be here
But youre in London and I break down
Cause its not fair that youre not around

This is when the feeling sinks in
I dont wanna miss you like this
Come back be here come back be here
I guess youre in New York today
And I dont wanna need you this way
Come back be here come back be here

Oh-oh oh-oh
I dont wanna miss you like this
Oh-oh oh-oh
Come back be here
Dont look at me you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that everybody knows that ah-ah
Dont look at me you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that

I dont even know her
But I feel a responsibility
To do whats upstanding and right
Its kinda like a code yeah
And youve been getting closer and closer
And crossing so many lines
And it would be a fine proposition
If I was a stupid girl
But honey I am no ones exception
This I have previously learned

So dont look at me you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that everybody knows that ah-ah
Dont look at me you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that everybody knows that
I see you turn off your phone
And now youve got me alone and I say
Dont look at me you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that everybody knows that

I just want to make sure
You understand perfectly
Youre the kind of man who makes me sad
While she waits up
You chase down the newest thing
And take for granted what you have

And it would be a fine proposition
If I was a stupid girl
And yeah I might go with it
If I hadnt once been just like her
So dont look at me you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that everybody knows that ah-ah
Dont look at me you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that everybody knows that
I see you turn off your phone
And now youve got me alone and I say
Dont look at me you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that everybody knows that

Oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh

Call a cab lose my number
Youre about to lose your girl
Call a cab lose my number
Lets consider this lesson learned

Dont look at me you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that everybody knows that ah-ah
Dont look at me you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that everybody knows that
Want to see you pick up your phone
And tell her youre coming home
Dont look at me you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that everybody knows that
Dont look at me you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that everybody knows that
It would be a fine proposition
Put your lips close to mine
As long as they don’t touch
Out of focus eye to eye
Till the gravity’s too much
And I’ll do anything you say
If you say it with your hands
And I’d be smart to walk away
But you’re quicksand

This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
And I I I like it
I can’t decide if it’s a choice
Getting swept away
I hear the sound of my own voice
Asking you to stay
And all we are is skin and bone
Trained to get along
Forever going with the flow
But you’re friction

This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
I I I like it
Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will get you get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should
Think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive
And I would follow you follow you home
I’ll follow you follow you home
This hope is treacherous
This daydream is dangerous
This hope is treacherous
I I I
I I I
I I I
Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will get you get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should
Think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive
And I would follow you follow you home
I’ll follow you follow you home
I’ll follow you follow you home
I’ll follow you follow you home
I’ll follow you follow you home
This slope is treacherous
Loving him is like
Driving a new Maserati down a dead end street
Faster than the wind passionate as sin ending so suddenly
Loving him is like
Trying to change your mind once youre already flying through the freefall
Like the colors in autumn
So bright just before they lose it all
Losing him was blue like Id never known
Missing him was dark grey all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody youve never met
But loving him was red
Loving him was red
Touching him was like
Realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as
Easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like
Trying to solve a crossword and realizing theres no right answer
Regretting him was like
Wishing you never found out that love could be that strong
Losing him was blue like Id never known
Missing him was dark grey all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody youve never met
But loving him was red
Oh red
Burning red
Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself its time now gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
In burning red
Burning it was red
Losing him was blue like Id never known
Missing him was dark grey all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
Cause loving him was red
Yeah yeah red
Were burning red

And thats why hes spinning round in my head
Burning red burning red
His love was like
Im walking fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love till it hurts or bleeds or fades in time

And I never saw you coming
And I’ll never be the same
You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannon ball
Now all we know is don’t let go
We are alone just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs four blue eyes

So you were never a saint
And Ive loved in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild

And I never saw you coming
And I’ll never be the same

This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
You’re my Achilles heel
This is the golden age of something good
And right and real
And I never saw you coming
And I’ll never be the same
And I never saw you coming
And I’ll never be the same

This is a state of grace
This is a worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him
Wondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted
But if hes a ghost then I can be a phantom
Holdin him for ransom some
Some boys are tryin too hard he dont try at all though
Younger than my exes but he act like such a man so
I see nothing better I keep him forever
Like a vendetta-ta

I I I see how this is gon go
Touch me and youll never be alone

No one has to know
In the middle of the night in my dreams
You should see the things we do baby
In the middle of the night in my dreams
I know Im gonna be with you so I take my time
Are you ready for it

Knew I was a robber first time that he saw me
Stealing hearts and running off and never sayin sorry
But if Im a thief then he can join the heist and
Well move to an island and
And he can be my jailer Burton to this Taylor
Every love Ive known in comparison is a failure
I forget their names now Im so very tame now
Never be the same now now

I I I see how this is gon go
Touch me and youll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know No one has to know

In the middle of the night in my dreams
You should see the things we do baby

Even when wed argue wed not do it for long
And you understand the good and bad end up in the song
For all your beautiful traits and the way you do it with ease
For all my flaws paranoia and insecurities
Ive made mistakes and made some choices thats hard to deny
After the storm something was born on the 4th of July
Ive passed days without fun this end game is the one
With four words on the tip of my tongue Ill never say it

Back against the wall
Trippin trip-trippin when youre gone

Cause we break down a little
But when you get me alone its so simple
Cause baby I know what you know
We can feel it
And all the pieces fall right into place
Getting caught up in a moment
Lipstick on your face
So it goes
Im yours to keep
And Im yours to lose
You know Im not a bad girl but I
Do bad things with you
So it goes

Met you in a bar
All eyes on me your illusionist
All eyes on us

And wear you like a necklace

Getting caught up in a moment
Lipstick on your face

No nothing good starts in a getaway car

It was the best of times the worst of crimes
I struck a match and blew your mind
But I didnt mean it and you didn’t see it
The ties were black the lies were white
In shades of gray in candlelight
I wanted to leave him I needed a reason
X marks the spot where we fell apart
He poisoned the well I was lyin to myself
I knew it from the first Old Fashioned we were cursed
We never had a shotgun shot in the dark Oh

You were drivin the getaway car
We were flyin’ but wed never get far
Dont pretend its such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
Ridin in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart
Shouldve known Id be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car oh-oh-oh
No they never get far oh-oh-ah
No nothing good starts in a getaway car

It was the great escape the prison break
The light of freedom on my face
But you werent thinkin’ and I was just drinkin’
While he was runnin after us I was screamin’ Go go go
But with three of us honey its a sideshow
And a circus aint a love story and now were both sorry
We’re both sorry
X marks the spot where we fell apart
He poisoned the well every man for himself
I knew it from the first Old Fashioned we were cursed
It hit you like a shotgun shot to the heart Oh

You were drivin the getaway car
We were flyin but wed never get far
Dont pretend its such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
Ridin in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart
Shouldve known Id be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car oh-oh-oh

Until I switched to the other side to the other side
Its no surprise I turned you in Oh-oh
Cause us traitors never win

Put the money in a bag and I stole the keys
That was the last time you ever saw me Oh
Drivin the getaway car
We were flyin but wed never get far Dont pretend
Dont pretend its such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
Ridin in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart Shouldve known

My my love had been frozen
Deep blue but you painted me golden
Oh and you held me close

Couldve spent forever with your hands in my pockets
Picture of your face in an invisible locket
You said there was nothing in the world that could stop it
I had a bad feeling
And darling you had turned my bed into a sacred oasis
People started talking putting us through our paces
I knew there was no one in the world who could take it
I had a bad feeling
But we were dancing
Dancing with our hands tied hands tied

Yeah we were dancing
Dancing with our hands tied hands tied

Swaying as the room burned down
Id hold you as the water rushes in
If I could dance with you again

Ooh-ooh ooh-ooh
Our secret moments in a crowded room
They got no idea about me and you
There is an indentation in the shape of you
Made your mark on me a golden tattoo

All of this silence and patience pining and anticipation
My hands are shaking from holding back from you
Ha ah ah
All of this silence and patience pining and desperately waiting
My hands are shaking from all this
Ah ha ha ha-ah
Say my name and everything just stops
I dont want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it off ha ha ha-ah
Carve your name into my bedpost
’Cause I dont want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it off ha ha ha-ah

Inescapable Im not even gonna try
And if I get burned at least we were electrified
I’m spilling wine in the bathtub
You kiss my face and were both drunk
Everyone thinks that they know us
But they know nothin about

All of this silence and patience pining and anticipation
My hands are shaking from holding back from you
Ha ah ah
All of this silence and patience pining and desperately waiting
My hands are shaking from all this
Ah ha ha ha-ah
Say my name and everything just stops
I dont want you like a best friend

Ha-ah-ah ha-ah-ah ha-ah-ah-ah
Only bought this dress so you could take it off

Flashback when you met me your buzzcut and my hair bleached
Even in my worst times you could see the best in me
Flashback to my mistakes my rebounds my earthquakes
Even in my worst lies you saw the truth in me
And I woke up just in time now I wake up by your side
My one and only my lifeline
I woke up just in time now I wake up by your side
My hands shake I cant explain this
Ah ha ha ha-ah
Say my name and everything just stops

’Cause I don’t want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it off ha ha ha-ah

There is an indentation in the shape of you
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
You made your mark on me golden tattoo
It was so nice throwing big parties
Jump into the pool from the balcony
Everyone swimming in a champagne sea
And there are no rules when you show up here
Bass beat rattling the chandelier
Feeling so Gatsby for that whole year

So whyd you have to rain on my parade
Im shaking my head and locking the gates
This is why we cant have nice things darling
Because you break them I had to take them away
This is why we cant have nice things honey Oh
Did you think I wouldnt hear all the things you said about me
This is why we cant have nice things

It was so nice being friends again
There I was giving you a second chance
But you stabbed me in the back while shaking my hand
And therein lies the issue friends dont try to trick you
Get you on the phone and mind-twist you
And so I took an axe to a mended fence

But Im not the only friend youve lost lately Mm-mm
If only you werent so shady
This is why we cant have nice things darling Yeah
Because you break them I had to take them away
This is why we cant have nice Nice things things Baby honey
Did you think I wouldnt hear all the things you said about me
This is why we cant have—
Heres a toast to my real friends

And heres to my mama
Had to listen to all this drama
And heres to you
Cause forgiveness is a nice thing to do
Haha I cant even say it with a straight face
This is why we cant have nice things darling Darling
Because you break them I had to take them away
This is why we cant have nice Uh-uh things Oh no honey Baby oh
Did you think I wouldnt hear all the things you said about me
This is why we cant have nice things darling
And heres to my real friends
Because you break them I had to take them
And heres to my baby
Nice things honey
They didnt care about that he-said she-said
Did you think I wouldnt hear all the things you said about me
My castle crumbled overnight
I brought a knife to a gunfight
They took the crown but its alright
All the liars are calling me one
Nobodys heard from me for months
Im doin better than I ever was
Cause

My babys fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like Im brand new
So call it what you want yeah
Call it what you want to
All my flowers grew back as thorns
Windows boarded up after the storm
He built a fire just to keep me warm
All the drama queens taking swings
All the jokers dressing up as kings
They fade to nothing when I look at him
And I know I make the same mistakes every time
Bridges burn I never learn
At least I did one thing right
I did one thing right
Im laughing with my lover makin forts under covers
Trust him like a brother
Yeah you know I did one thing right
Starry eyes sparkin up my darkest night

My babys fit like a daydream

Chain round my neck

Holding my breath slowly I said

But would you run away with me
Yes Would you run away

Theres glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me from the night before but

Don’t read the last page
But I stay when youre lost and Im scared and you’re turning away
I want your midnights
But Ill be cleaning up bottles with you on New Years Day
You squeeze my hand three times in the back of the taxi
I can tell that its gonna be a long road
Ill be there if youre the toast of the town babe
Or if you strike out and youre crawling home

Dont read the last page
But I stay when it’s hard or it’s wrong or were making mistakes
I want your midnights
But I’ll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Years Day

Hold on to the memories they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories they will hold on to you
And I will hold on to you

Please dont ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
Please dont ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere

There’s glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me forevermore
Dont read the last page
But I stay when its hard or its wrong or were making mistakes
I want your midnights
But Ill be cleaning up bottles with you on New Years Day

Hold on to the memories they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories they will hold on to you
And I will hold on to you

Please dont ever become a stranger
To the memories they will hold on to you
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
Hold on to the memories they will hold on to you
Please dont ever become a stranger
Hold on to the memories they will hold on to you
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
Cracked her bones on the pavement she once decorated
as a child with sidewalk chalk
When she crashed her clothes disintegrated and blew away
with the winds that took all of her fair-weather friends
When she looked around her skin was spattered with ink
forming the words of a thousand voices
Echoes she heard even in her sleep
Whatever you say it is not right
Whatever you do it is not enough
Your kindness is fake
Your pain is manipulative
When she lay there on the ground
She dreamed of time machines and revenge
and a love that was really something
Not just the idea of something
When she finally rose she rose slowly
Avoiding old haunts and sidestepping shiny pennies
Wary of phone calls and promises
Charmers dandies and get-love-quick-schemes
When she stood she stood with a desolate knowingness
Waded out into the dark wild ocean up to her neck
Bathed in her brokenness
Said a prayer of gratitude for each chink in the armor
she never knew she needed
Standing broad-shouldered next to her
was a love that was really something
not just the idea of something
When she turned to go home
She heard the echoes of new words
May your heart remain breakable
But never by the same hand twice
And even louder
without your past
you could never have arrived-
so wondrously and brutally
By design or some violent exquisite happenstance
here
We think we know someone but the truth is that we only know the version of them they have chosen to show us We know our friend in a certain light but we dont know them the way their lover does Just the way their lover will never know them the same way that you do as their friend Their mother knows them differently than their roommate who knows them differently than their colleague Their secret admirer looks at them and sees an elaborate sunset of brilliant color and dimension and spirit and pricelessness And yet a stranger will pass that person and see a faceless member of the crowd nothing more We may hear rumors about a person and believe those things to be true We may one day meet that person and feel foolish for believing baseless gossip
This is the first generation that will be able to look back on their entire life story documented in pictures on the internet and together we will all discover the after-effects of that Ultimately we post photos online to curate what strangers think of us But then we wake up look in the mirror at our faces and see the cracks and scars and blemishes and cringe We hope someday well meet someone who will see that same morning face and instead see their future their partner their forever Someone who will still choose us even when they see all of the sides of the story all the angles of the kaleidoscope that is you
The point being despite our need to simplify and generalize absolutely everyone and everything in this life humans are intrinsically impossible to simplify We are never just good or just bad We are mosaics of our worst selves and our best selves our deepest secrets and our favorite stories to tell at a dinner party existing somewhere between our well-lit profile photo and our drivers license shot We are all a mixture of our selfishness and generosity loyalty and self-preservation pragmatism and impulsiveness Ive been in the public eye since I was 15 years old On the beautiful lovely side of that Ive been so lucky to make music for living and look out into crowds of loving vibrant people On the other side of the coin my mistakes have been used against me my heartbreaks have been used as entertainment and my songwriting has been trivialized as oversharing
When this album comes out gossip blogs will scour the lyrics for the men they can attribute to each song as if the inspiration for music is as simple and basic as a paternity test There will be slideshows of photos backing up each incorrect theory because its 2017 and if you didnt see a picture of it it couldnt have happened right
Let me say it again louder for those in the back
We think we know someone but the truth is that we only know the version of them that they have chosen to show us
There will be no further explanation
You bite your nails
And laugh when youre nervous
You promise people the world
because thats what they want from you
You like giving them what they want
But darling you need to stop
If youre anything like me
You knock on wood every time you make plans
You cross your fingers hold your breath
Wish on lucky numbers and eyelashes
Your superstitions were the lone survivors of the shipwreck
Rest In Peace to your naive bravado
If life gets too good now
Darling it scares you
If youre anything like me
You never wanted to lock your door
Your secret garden gate or your diary drawer
Didnt want to face the you you dont know anymore
For fear she was much better before
But Darling now you have to
If youre anything like me
Theres a justice system in your head
For names youll never speak again
And you make your ruthless rulings
Each new enemy turns to steel
They become the bars that confine you
In your own little golden prison cell
But Darling there is where you meet yourself
If youre anything like me
Youve grown to hate your pride
To love your thighs
And no amount of friends at 25
Will fill the empty seats
At the lunch tables of your past
The teams that picked you last
But Darling you keep trying
If youre anything like me
You couldnt recognize the face of your love
Until they stripped you of your shiny paint
Threw your victory flag away
And you saw the ones who wanted you anyway
Darling later on you will thank your stars
for that frightful day
Im sorry
Oh-oh oh-oh
Oh-oh oh-oh

You were in college working part time waitin tables
Left a small town never looked back
I was a flight risk with a fear of falling
Wonderin why we bother with love if it never lasts

I say Can you believe it
As were lyin on the couch
The moment I could see it
Yes yes I can see it now
Do you remember we were sittin there by the water
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter
You are the best thing thats ever been mine

Flash forward and were takin on the world together
And theres a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why Im guarded
You say well never make my parents mistakes

But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes yes this is what I thought about

Do you remember we were sittin there by the water
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter
You are the best thing thats ever been mine
Do you remember all the city lights on the water
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter
You are the best thing thats ever been mine
Oh-oh oh-oh

And I remember that fight 230 AM
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street
Braced myself for the goodbye
Cause thats all Ive ever known
Then you took me by surprise
You said Ill never leave you alone

You said I remember how we felt sitting by the water
And every time I look at you its like the first time
I fell in love with a careless mans careful daughter
She is the best thing thats ever been mine

Hold on make it last
Hold on never turn back
Hold on You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter Make it last
Hold on You are the best thing thats ever been mine Hold on

Yes yes do you believe it Hold on
Yes yes were gonna make it now Hold on
Yes yes I can see it
The way you move is like a full on rainstorm and Im a house of cards
Youre the kind of reckless that should send me runnin
But I kinda know that I wont get far
And you stood there in front of me just close enough to touch
Close enough to hope you couldnt see what I was thinkin of

Drop everything now meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk take away the pain
Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes baby as the lights go down
Give me something thatll haunt me when youre not around
Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
My mind forgets to remind me youre a bad idea
You touch me once and its really somethin
You find Im even better than you imagined I would be
Im on my guard for the rest of the world
But with you I know its no good
And I could wait patiently but I really wish you would

Drop everything now meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk take away the pain
Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes baby as the lights go down
Give me something thatll haunt me when youre not around
Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

I run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild
Just keep on keepin your eyes on me its just wrong enough to make it feel right
And lead me up the staircase wont you whisper soft and slow
Im captivated by you baby like a firework show

Drop everything now meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk Ah-ah take away the pain
Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes baby as the lights go down
Give me something thatll haunt me when youre not around
Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
And the sparks fly
Oh baby smile
Im so glad you made time to see me
Hows life Tell me hows your family
I havent seen them in a while
Youve been good busier than ever
We small talk work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why

Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying Im sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom aint nothing but missing you
Wishing Id realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time

These days I havent been sleeping
Staying up playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed and I didnt call
And I think about summer all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side
And realized I loved you in the fall

And then the cold came the dark days
When fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying Im sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom aint nothing but missing you
Wishing Id realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time
I miss your tan skin your sweet smile
So good to me so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again I swear Id love you right
Id go back in time and change it but I cant
So if the chain is on your door I understand

But this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying Im sorry for that night
And I go back to December
It turns out freedom aint nothing but missing you
Wishing Id realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December turn around and make it alright
I go back to December turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely bargin in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl
I sneak in and see your friends
And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Somewhere back inside a room
Wearin a gown shaped like a pastry
This is surely not what you thought it would be
I lose myself in a daydream
Where I stand and say

Dont say yes run away now
Ill meet you when youre out
Of the church at the back door
Dont wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said Speak now

Fond gestures are exchanged
And the organ starts to play a song that sounds like a death march
And I am hiding in the curtains
It seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be

She floats down the aisle like a pageant queen
But I know you wish it was me
You wish it was me dont you

Dont say yes run away now
Ill meet you when youre out
Of the church at the back door
Dont wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said Speak now
Dont say yes run away now Run away now
Ill meet you when youre out
Of the church at the back door
Dont wait or say a single vow Say a single vow
Your time is running out
And they said Speak now
Ooh Run away now la
Ooh Say a single vow ooh

I hear the preacher say
Speak now or forever hold your peace
Theres the silence theres my last chance
I stand up with shaky hands all eyes on me
Horrified looks from everyone in the room
But Im only lookin at you

I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely bargin in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl haha

So dont say yes run away now
Ill meet you when youre out
Of the church at the back door
Dont wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
They said Speak now
And you say Lets run away now Run away now
Ill meet you when Im out
Of my tux at the back door
Baby I didnt say my vows Say a single vow
So glad you were around
Long were the nights when
My days once revolved around you
Counting my footsteps
Praying the floor wont fall through again
And my mother accused me of losing my mind
But I swore I was fine
You paint me a blue sky
Then go back and turn it to rain
And I lived in your chess game
But you changed the rules everyday
Wondering which version of you I might get on the phone tonight
Well I stopped pickin up and this song is to let you know why
Dear John I see it all now that youre gone
Dont you think I was too young to be messed with
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I shouldve known

Well maybe its me
And my blind optimism to blame
Or maybe its you and your sick need
To give love and take it away
And youll add my name to your long list of traitors
Who dont understand
And I look back in regret how I ignored when they said
Run as fast as you can

Dear John I see it all now that youre gone
Dont you think I was too young to be messed with
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
Dear John I see it all now it was wrong
Dont you think nineteens too young
To be played by your dark twisted games when I loved you so
I shouldve known

You are an expert at sorry and keeping lines blurry
Never impressed by me acing your tests
All the girls that youve run dry have tired lifeless eyes
Cause you burned them out
But I took your matches before fire could catch me
So dont look now
Im shining like fireworks over your sad empty town
Oh oh
Dear John I see it all now that youre gone
Dont you think I was too young to be messed with
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I see it all now that youre gone
Dont you think I was too young to be messed with
The girl in the dress wrote you a song
You shouldve known

You shouldve known
Dont you think I was too young
You with your words like knives
And swords and weapons that you use against me
You have knocked me off my feet again
Got me feeling like a nothing
You with your voice like nails on a chalkboard
Calling me out when Im wounded
You pickin on the weaker man

Well you can take me down
With just one single blow
But you dont know what you dont know
Someday Ill be livin in a big old city
And all youre ever gonna be is mean
Someday Ill be big enough so you cant hit me
And all youre ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean

You with your switching sides
And your wildfire lies and your humiliation
You have pointed out my flaws again
As if I dont already see them
I walk with my head down trying to block you out
Cause Ill never impress you
I just wanna feel okay again

I bet you got pushed around
Somebody made you cold
But the cycle ends right now
Cause you cant lead me down that road
And you dont know what you dont know

Someday Ill be livin in a big old city
And all youre ever gonna be is mean
Someday Ill be big enough so you cant hit me
And all youre ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean
And I can see you years from now in a bar
Talking over a football game
With that same big loud opinion
But nobodys listening
Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things
Drunk and grumblin on about how I cant sing
But all you are is mean

All you are is mean
And a liar and pathetic
And alone in life and mean
And mean and mean and mean

But someday Ill be livin in a big old city
And all youre ever gonna be is mean
Yeah someday Ill be big enough so you cant hit me
And all youre ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean
Someday Ill be livin in a big old city
Why you gotta be so mean
And all youre ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean
Someday Ill be big enough so you cant hit me
Why you gotta be so mean
And all youre ever gonna be is mean
I used to think one day wed tell the story of us
How we met and the sparks flew instantly
And people would say Theyre the lucky ones
I used to know my place was the spot next to you
Now Im searching the room for an empty seat
Cause lately I dont even know what page youre on

Oh a simple complication
Miscommunications lead to fallout
So many things that I wish you knew
So many walls up I cant break through
Now Im standing alone in a crowded room
And were not speaking
And Im dying to know
Is it killing you like its killing me Yeah
I dont know what to say since the twist of fate
When it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now

Next chapter

Howd we end up this way
See me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy
And youre doing your best to avoid me
Im starting to think one day Ill tell the story of us
How I was losing my mind when I saw you here
But you held your pride like you shouldve held me

Oh Im scared to see the ending
Why are we pretending this is nothing
Id tell you I miss you but I dont know how
Ive never heard silence quite this loud
Now Im standing alone in a crowded room
And were not speaking
And Im dying to know
Is it killing you like its killing me Yeah
I dont know what to say since the twist of fate
When it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now

This is looking like a contest
Of who can act like they care less
But I liked it better when you were on my side
The battles in your hands now
But I would lay my armor down
If you said youd rather love than fight

So many things that you wish I knew
But the story of us might be ending soon

Now Im standing alone in a crowded room
And were not speaking
And Im dying to know
Is it killing you like its killing me Yeah
I dont know what to say since the twist of fate
When it all broke down
The story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now now now
And were not speaking
And Im dying to know
Is it killing you like its killing me Yeah
I dont know what to say since the twist of fate
Cause were goin down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now

Your little hands wrapped around my finger
And its so quiet in the world tonight
Your little eyelids flutter cause youre dreaming
So I tuck you in turn on your favorite nightlight
To you everythings funny
You got nothing to regret
Id give all I have honey
If you could stay like that

Oh darling dont you ever grow up
Dont you ever grow up just stay this little
Oh darling dont you ever grow up
Dont you ever grow up it could stay this simple
I wont let nobody hurt you
Wont let no one break your heart
And no one will desert you
Just try to never grow up
Never grow up
Youre in the car on the way to the movies
And youre mortified your moms dropping you off
At fourteen theres just so much you cant do
And you cant wait to move out someday and call your own shots
But dont make her drop you off around the block
Remember that shes getting older too
And dont lose the way that you dance around
In your PJs getting ready for school

Oh darling dont you ever grow up
Dont you ever grow up just stay this little
Oh darling dont you ever grow up
Dont you ever grow up it could stay this simple
No ones ever burned you
Nothings ever left you scarred
And even though you want to
Just try to never grow up

Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home
Remember the footsteps remember the words said
And all your little brothers favorite songs
I just realized everything I have is someday gonna be gone
So here I am in my new apartment
In a big city they just dropped me off
Its so much colder than I thought it would be
So I tuck myself in and turn my nightlight on
Wish Id never grown up
I wish Id never grown up
Oh I dont wanna grow up
Wish Id never grown up I could still be little
Oh I dont wanna grow up
Wish Id never grown up it could still be simple
Oh darling dont you ever grow up
Dont you ever grow up just stay this little
Oh darling dont you ever grow up
Dont you ever grow up it could stay this simple
Wont let nobody hurt you
Wont let no one break your heart
And even though you want to
Please try to never grow up

Oh oh
Dont you ever grow up
There I was again tonight
Forcing laughter faking smiles
Same old tired lonely place
Walls of insincerity
Shifting eyes and vacancy
Vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you
Your eyes whispered Have we met
Across the room your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy
And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you
This night is sparkling dont you let it go
Im wonderstruck blushing all the way home
Ill spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

The lingering question kept me up
2 am who do you love
I wonder til Im wide awake
Now Im pacing back and forth
Wishing you were at my door
Id open up and you would say
Hey it was enchanting to meet you
All I know is I was enchanted to meet you

This night is sparkling dont you let it go
Im wonderstruck blushing all the way home
Ill spend forever wondering if you knew
This night is flawless dont you let it go
Im wonderstruck dancing around all alone
Ill spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

This is me praying that
This was the very first page
Not where the storyline ends
My thoughts will echo your name
Until I see you again
These are the words I held back
As I was leaving too soon
I was enchanted to meet you
Please dont be in love with someone else
Please dont have somebody waiting on you
Please dont be in love with someone else Ooh
Please dont have somebody waiting on you Ooh oh

This night is sparkling dont you let it go
Im wonderstruck blushing all the way home
Ill spend forever wondering if you knew
This night is flawless Please dont be in love with someone else
Dont you let it go
Im wonderstruck Please dont have somebody waiting on you
Dancing around all alone
Ill spend forever Please dont be in love with someone else
Wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you
Please dont be in love with someone else
Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did
Ha time for a little revenge

The story starts when it was hot and it was summer and
I had it all I had him right there where I wanted him
She came along got him alone and lets hear the applause
She took him faster than you can say Sabotage
I never saw it coming wouldnt have suspected it
I underestimated just who I was dealing with
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealing from
Shes not a saint and shes not what you think
Shes an actress whoa
Shes better known for the things that she does
On the mattress whoa
Soon shes gonna find stealing other peoples toys
On the playground wont make you many friends
She should keep in mind she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge ha

She looks at life like its a party and shes on the list
She looks at me like Im a trend and shes so over it
I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling
And she thinks Im psycho cause I like to rhyme her name with things
But sophistication isnt what you wear or who you know
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
Oh they didnt teach you that in prep school so its up to me
But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity
Think about what you did

Shes not a saint and shes not what you think
Shes an actress whoa
Shes better known for the things that she does
On the mattress whoa
Soon shes gonna find stealing other peoples toys
On the playground wont make you many friends
She should keep in mind she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge ha
Im just another thing for you to roll your eyes at honey
You might have him but havent you heard
Im just another thing for you to roll your eyes at honey
You might have him but I always get the last word
Whoa whoa-ah-oh

Shes not a saint and shes not what you think
Shes an actress whoa She deserved it
Shes better known for the things that she does
On the mattress whoa
Soon shes gonna find stealing other peoples toys
On the playground wont make you many friends
She should keep in mind she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge

Do you still feel like you know what youre doing
Cause I dont think you do oh No no no no
Do you still feel like you know what youre doing No
I dont think you do I dont think you do
Lets hear the applause Come on come on
Come on show me how much better you are
So much better yeah
See you deserve some applause
Cause youre so much better
I guess you really did it this time
Left yourself in your war path
Lost your balance on a tightrope
Lost your mind trying to get it back

Wasnt it easier in your lunchbox days
Always a bigger bed to crawl into
Wasnt it beautiful when you believed in everything
And everybody believed in you
Its alright just wait and see
Your string of lights are still bright to me oh
Who you are is not where youve been
Youre still an innocent
Youre still an innocent

Did some things you cant speak of
But at night you live it all again
You wouldnt be shattered on the floor now
If only you had seen what you know now then

Wasnt it easier in your firefly-catching days
When everything out of reach
Someone bigger brought down to you
Wasnt it beautiful running wild til you fell asleep
Before the monsters caught up to you

Its alright just wait and see
Your string of lights are still bright to me oh
Who you are is not where youve been
Youre still an innocent
Its okay and life is a tough crowd
Thirty-two and still growing up now
Who you are is not what you did
Youre still an innocent
Time turns flames to embers
Youll have new Septembers
Every one of us has messed up too ooh
Minds change like the weather
I hope you remember
Today is never too late to be brand new oh

Its alright just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me oh
Who you are is not where youve been
Youre still an innocent
Its okay and life is a tough crowd
Thirty-two and still growing up now
Who you are is not what you did
Youre still an innocent
Youre still an innocent

Lost your balance on a tightrope oh
You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
But I never thought Id live to see it break
Its getting dark and its all too quiet
And I cant trust anything now
And its coming over you like its all a big mistake

Woah holding my breath
Wont lose you again
Somethings made your eyes go cold
Come on come on dont leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Somethings gone terribly wrong
Youre all I wanted
Come on come on dont leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Cant breathe whenever youre gone
Cant turn back now Im haunted

Stood there and watched you walk away
From everything we had
But I still mean every word I said to you
He will try to take away my pain
And he just might make me smile
But the whole time Im wishing he was you instead

Oh holding my breath
Wont see you again
Something keeps me holding onto nothing

Come on come on dont leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Somethings gone terribly wrong
Youre all I wanted
Come on come on dont leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Cant breathe whenever youre gone
Cant turn back now Im haunted
I know I know
I just know
Youre not gone
You cant be gone no

Come on come on dont leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Somethings gone terribly wrong
Wont finish what you started
Come on come on dont leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Cant breathe whenever youre gone
I cant go back Im haunted

Oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh oh
You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
Never ever thought Id see it break
I still remember the look on your face
Lit through the darkness at 158
The words that you whispered for just us to know
You told me you loved me
So why did you go away
Away

I do recall now the smell of the rain
Fresh on the pavement
I ran off the plane
That July ninth the beat of your heart
It jumps through your shirt
I can still feel your arms
But now Ill go
Sit on the floor wearing your clothes
All that I know is I dont know
How to be something you miss

I never thought wed have a last kiss
Never imagined wed end like this
Your name forever the name on my lips

I do remember the swing of your step
The life of the party youre showing off again
And Id roll my eyes and then youd pull me in
Im not much for dancing but for you I did
Because I love your handshake meeting my father
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
How youd kiss me when I was in the middle of saying something
Theres not a day I dont miss those rude interruptions

And Ill go
Sit on the floor wearing your clothes
All that I know is I dont know
How to be something you miss
I never thought wed have a last kiss
I never imagined wed end like this
Your name forever the name on my lips ooh

So Ill watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep
And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe
And Ill keep up with our old friends
Just to ask them how you are
Hope its nice where you are
And I hope the sun shines and its a beautiful day
And something reminds you you wish you had stayed
You can plan for a change in the weather and time
But I never planned on you changing your mind

So Ill go
Sit on the floor wearing your clothes
All that I know is I dont know
How to be something you miss

I never thought wed have a last kiss
Never imagined wed end like this
Your name forever the name on my lips
Just like our last kiss
Forever the name on my lips
Forever the name on my lips
I said Remember this moment
In the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in stands went wild
We were the kings and the queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives would
Never be the same
You held your head like a hero on a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age
Long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming Long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
One day we will be remembered

I said Remember this feeling
I pass the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines
Wishing for right now
We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town
And the cynics were outraged
Screaming This is absurd
Cause for a moment a band of thieves in ripped up jeans
Got to rule the world

Long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming Long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders Im not afraid
Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
I was screaming Long live that look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day we will be remembered
Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall
Will you take a moment Promise me this
That youll stand by me forever
But if God forbid fate should step in
And force us into a goodbye
If you have children some day
When they point to the pictures
Please tell em my name
Tell em how the crowds went wild
Tell em how I hope they shine
Long live the walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life with you

Long long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
And I was screaming Long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders Im not afraid
Singing Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
And long long live that look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
Elevator buttons and morning air
Strangers silence makes me want to take the stairs
If you were here wed laugh about their vacant stares
But right now my time is theirs
Seems like theres always someone who disapproves
Theyll judge it like they know about me and you
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
The jurys out but my choice is you

So dont you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high the waters rough
But this love is ours
You never know what people have up their sleeves
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
But I dont care cause right now youre mine
And youll say

Dont you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high the waters rough
But this love is ours

And its not theirs to speculate if its wrong and
Your hands are tough but they are where mine belong and
Ill fight their doubt and give you faith with this song for you
Cause I love the gap between your teeth
And I love the riddles that you speak
And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos
Will be ignored cause my heart is yours

So dont you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
Dont you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
But they cant take whats ours
They cant take whats ours
The stakes are high the waters rough
Last night I heard my own heart beating
Sounded like footsteps on my stairs
Six months gone and Im still reaching
Even though I know youre not there
I was playing back a thousand memories baby
Thinking bout everything weve been through
Maybe Ive been going back too much lately
When time stood still and I had you

Come back come back come back to me like
You would you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside til I came out
Come back come back come back to me like
You could you could if you just said youre sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie youd be here by now
I know people change and these things happen
But I remember how it was back then
Wrapped up in your arms and our friends were laughin
Cause nothing like this ever happened to them
Now Im pacing down the hall chasing down your street
Flashback to the night when you said to me
That nothings gonna change not for me and you
Not before I knew how much I had to lose

Come back come back come back to me like
You would you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside til I came out
Come back come back come back to me like
You could you could if you just said youre sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie youd be here by now

If youre out there if youre somewhere if youre moving on
Ive been waiting for you ever since youve been gone
I just want it back the way it was before
And I just want to see you back at my front door

And I say Come back come back come back to me like
You would before you said its not that easy
Before the fight before I locked you out
But I take it all back now
Come back come back come back to me like
You would you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside til I came out
Come back come back come back to me like
You could you could if you just said youre sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie youd be here by now

Youd be here by now
Its not the kind of ending you want to see now
Baby what about the ending
Oh I thought youd be here by now
Oh oh
Tall dark and superman
He puts papers in his briefcase and drives away
To save the world or go to work
Its the same thing to me
Hes got his mothers eyes his fathers ambition
I wonder if he knows how much that I miss him
I hang on every word you say yay
And you smile and say How are you”
I say Just fine
I always forget to tell you I love you
I love you forever
I watch superman fly away
Youve got a busy day today
Go save the world Ill be around
I watch superman fly away
Come back Ill be with you someday
Ill be right here on the ground
When you come back down

Tall dark and beautiful
Hes complicated hes irrational
But I hope someday youll take me away and save the day yeah
Something in his deep brown eyes has me sayin
Hes not all bad like his reputation
And I cant hear one single word they say
And youll leave got places to be and Ill be okay
I always forget to tell you I love you
I loved you from the very first day

I watch superman fly away
Youve got a busy day today
Go save the world Ill be around
I watch superman fly away
Come back Ill be with you someday
Ill be right here on the ground
When you come back down
And I watch you fly around the world
And I hope you dont save some other girl
Dont forget dont forget about me
Im far away but I never let you go
Im love-struck and looking out the window
Dont forget dont forget where Ill be

Right here wishing the flowers were from you
Wishing the card was from you
Wishing the call was from you
Cause I loved you from the very first day

I watch superman fly away
Youve got a busy day today
Go save the world Ill be around
Forever and ever here
I watch superman fly away
I swear Ill be with you someday
Ill be right here on the ground
When you come back down

La la la la la la
La la la la la la
Im so glad you made time to see me
Hows life Tell me hows your family
I havent seen them in a while
Youve been good busier than ever
We small talk work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why

Because the last time
You saw me is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying Im sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom aint nothing but missing you
Wishing Id realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time

These days I havent been sleeping
Staying up playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed and I didnt call
Then I think about summer all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side
And realized I loved you in the fall

And then the cold came
The dark days when fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying Im sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom aint nothing but missing you
Wishing Id realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time
I miss your tan skin your sweet smile
So good to me so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again I swear Id love you right
Id go back in time and change it but I cant
So if the chain is on your door I understand

But this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying Im sorry for that night
And I go back to December
It turns out freedom aint nothing but missing you
Wishing Id realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December turn around and make it alright
I go back to December turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
But I never thought Id live to see it break
Its getting dark and its all too quiet
And I cant trust anything now
And its coming over you like its all a big mistake

Woah holding my breath
Wont lose you again
Somethings made your eyes go cold
Come on come on dont leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Somethings gone terribly wrong
Youre all I wanted
Come on come on dont leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Cant breathe whenevеr youre gone
Cant turn back now Im haunted

Stood thеre and watched you walk away Walk away
From everything we had
But I still mean every word I said to you
He will try to take away my pain
And he just might make me smile
But the whole time Im wishing he was you instead

Oh-woah holding my breath
Wont see you again
Something keeps me holding onto nothing

Come on come on dont leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Somethings gone terribly wrong
Youre all I wanted
Come on come on dont leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Cant breathe whenever youre gone
Cant turn back now Im haunted
I know I know
I just know
Youre not gone
You cant be gone no

Come on come on dont leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Somethings gone terribly wrong
Wont finish what you started
Come on come on dont leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Cant breathe whenever youre gone
I cant go back Im haunted

Oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh oh
You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
Never ever thought Id see it break
Ah-ah ah
Ah-ah ah

You were in college working part-time waiting tables
Left a small town never looked back
I was a flight risk with a fear of falling
Wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts

I say Can you believe it
As were lying on the couch
The moment I could see it
Yes yes I can see it now
Do you remember we were sitting there by the water
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter
You are the best thing thats ever been mine

Flash forward and were taking on the world together
And theres a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why Im guarded
You say well never make my parents mistakes

But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes yes this is what I thought about

Do you remember we were sitting there by the water
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter
You are the best thing thats ever been mine
Do you remember all the city lights on the water
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter
You are the best thing thats ever been mine
Oh-oh oh

And I remember that fight 230 am 
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street
Braced myself for the goodbye
Cause thats all Ive ever known
Then you took me by surprise
You said Ill never leave you alone

You said I remember how we felt sitting by the water
And every time I look at you its like the first time
I fell in love with a careless mans careful daughter
She is the best thing thats ever been mine

Hold on make it last
Hold on never turn back
Hold on You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter
Hold on You are the best thing thats ever been mine

Hold on
Do you believe it Hold on
Were gonna make it now Hold on
And I can see it
Speak now or forever hold your peace the words said by preachers at the end of wedding ceremonies all over the world right before the vows Its a last chance for protest a moment that makes everyones heart race and a moment Ive always been strangely fascinated by So many fantasize about bursting into a church saying what theyd kept inside for years like in the movies In real life it rarely happens
Real life is a funny thing you know In real life saying the right thing at the right moment is beyond crucial So crucial in fact the most of us start to hesitate for fear of saying the wrong thing at the wrong time But lately what Ive begun to fear more than that is letting the moment pass without saying anything
I think most of us fear reaching the end of our life and looking back regretting the moments we didnt speak up When we didnt say I love you When we shouldve said Im sorry When we didnt stand up for ourselves or someone who needed help
These songs are made up of words I didn’t say when the moment was right in front of me These songs are open letters Each is written with a specific person in mind telling them what I meant to tell them in person To the beautiful boy whose heart I broke in December To my first love who I never thought would be my first heartbreak To my band To a mean man I used to be afraid of To someone who made my world very dark for a while To a girl who stole something of mine To someone I forgive for what he said in front of the whole world
Words can break someone into a million pieces but they can also put them back together I hope you use yours for good because the only words you’ll regret more than the ones left unsaid are the ones you use to intentionally hurt someone
What you say might be too much for some people Maybe it will come out all wrong and you’ll stutter and you’ll walk away embarrassed wincing as you play it all back in your head But I think the words you stop yourself from saying are the ones that will haunt you the longest
So say it to them Or say it to yourself in the mirror Say it in a letter you’ll never send or in a book millions might read someday I think you deserve to look back on your life without a chorus of resounding voices saying ‘I could’ve but it’s too late now’
There is a time for silence There is a time waiting your turn But if you know how you feel and you so clearly know what you need to say you’ll know it
I dont think you should wait I think you should speak now

He said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said Thats a lie
Just a boy in a Chevy truck
That had a tendency of gettin stuck
On backroads at night
And I was right there beside him all summer long
And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone

But when you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me
September saw a month of tears
And thankin God that you werent here
To see me like that
But in a box beneath my bed
Is a letter that you never read
From three summers back
Its hard not to find it all a little bittersweet
And lookin back on all of that its nice to believe

When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

And Im back for the first time since then
Im standin on your street
And theres a letter left on your doorstep
And the first thing that youll read is
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
Someday youll turn your radio on
I hope it takes you back to that place
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me
Oh think of me
Mmmm

He said the way my blue eyes shine
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
State the obvious I didnt get my perfect fantasy
I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
So go and tell your friends that Im obsessive and crazy
Thats fine you wont mind if I say
By the way

I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
Youre a redneck heartbreak whos really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as Im concerned youre just another picture to burn
Theres no time for tears
Im just sitting here planning my revenge
Theres nothing stopping me
From going out with all of your best friends
And if you come around saying sorry to me
My daddys gonna show you how sorry youll be

Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
Youre a redneck heartbreak whos really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as Im concerned youre just another picture to burn

And if youre missing me youd better keep it to yourself
Cause coming back around here would be bad for your health

Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
Youre a redneck heartbreak whos really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
In case you havent heard
I really really hate that
Stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
Youre a redneck heartbreak whos really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as Im concerned youre just another picture to burn
Burn burn burn baby burn
Youre just another picture to burn
Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he wont see
That I want and Im needing
Everything that we should be

Ill bet shes beautiful
That girl he talks about
And shes got everything that I have to live without
Drew talks to me
I laugh cause its just so funny
That I cant even see
Anyone when hes with me

He says hes so in love
Hes finally got it right
I wonder if he knows hes all I think about at night

Hes the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
Hes the song in the car I keep singing
Dont know why I do

Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I cant breathe
And there he goes so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be

Shed better hold him tight
Give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know shes lucky cause
Hes the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
Hes the song in the car I keep singing
Dont know why I do

So I drive home alone
As I turn off the light
Ill put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight

Cause hes the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who’s got enough for me to break my heart
Hes the song in the car I keep singing
Dont know why I do
Hes the time taken up but theres never enough
And hes all that I need to fall into

Drew looks at me
I dont know what I want so dont ask me
Cause Im still trying to figure it out
Dont know whats down this road Im just walking
Trying to see through the rain coming down
Even though Im not the only one
Who feels the way I do

Im alone on my own and thats all I know
Ill be strong Ill be wrong oh but life goes on
Oh Im just a girl trying to find a place in this world
Got the radio on my old blue jeans
And Im wearing my heart on my sleeve
Feeling lucky today got the sunshine
Could you tell me what more do I need
And tomorrows just a mystery oh yeah
But thats okay

Im alone on my own and thats all I know
Ill be strong Ill be wrong oh but life goes on
Oh Im just a girl trying to find a place in this world

Maybe Im just a girl on a mission
But Im ready to fly

Im alone on my own and thats all I know
Ill be strong Ill be wrong oh but life goes on
Oh Im alone on my own and thats all I know
Oh Im just a girl trying to find a place in this world

Oh Im just a girl
Oh Im just a girl oh oh
You have a way of coming easily to me
And when you take you take the very best of me
So I start a fight cause I need to feel something
And you do what you want cause Im not what you wanted

Oh what a shame what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
Just walk away aint no use defending words that you will never say
And now that Im sitting here thinking it through
Ive never been anywhere cold as you
You put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray
And I stood there loving you and wished them all away
And you come away with a great little story
Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you

Oh what a shame what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
So just walk away aint no use defending words that you will never say
And now that Im sitting here thinking it through
Ive never been anywhere cold as you

You never did give a damn thing honey but I cried cried for you
And I know you wouldnt have told nobody if I died died for you
Died for you

Oh what a shame what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
Every smile you fake is so condescending
Counting all the scars you made
And now that Im sitting here thinking it through
Ive never been anywhere cold as you
I didnt know what I would find
When I went looking for a reason I know
I didnt read between the lines
And baby Ive got nowhere to go

I tried to take the road less traveled by
But nothing seems to work the first few times
Am I right
So how can I ever try to be better
Nobody ever lets me in
I can still see you this aint the best view
On the outside looking in
Ive been a lot of lonely places
Ive never been on the outside

You saw me there but never knew
That I would give it all up to be
A part of this a part of you
And now its all too late so you see

You couldve helped if you had wanted to
But no one notices until its too
Late to do anything

How can I ever try to be better
Nobody ever lets me in
I can still see you this aint the best view
On the outside looking in
Ive been a lot of lonely places
Ive never been on the outside
Oh yeah

How can I ever try to be better
Nobody ever lets me in
And I can still see you this aint the best view
On the outside looking in
Ive been a lot of lonely places
Ive never been on the outside

Oh-oh
Oh oh-oh
Oh-oh
Seems the only one who doesnt see your beauty
Is the face in the mirror looking back at you
You walk around here thinking youre not pretty
But thats not true
Cause I know you

Hold on baby youre losing it
The waters high youre jumping into it and letting go
And no one knows
That you cry but you dont tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And youre tied together with a smile
But youre coming undone oh
I guess its true that love was all you wanted
Cause youre giving it away like its extra change
Hoping it will end up in his pocket Pocket
But he leaves you out like a penny in the rain
Oh cause its not his price to pay
Its not his price to pay

Hold on baby youre losing it
The waters high youre jumping into it and letting go
And no one knows
That you cry but you dont tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And youre tied together with a smile
But youre coming undone oh
Oh oh

Hold on baby youre losing it
The waters high youre jumping into it and letting go
And no one knows
That you cry but you dont tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And youre tied together with a smile
But youre coming undone oh
Youre tied together with a smile
But youre coming undone oh oh-oh
Goodbye baby
With a smile baby baby
Coreys eyes are like a jungle
He smiles its like the radio
He whispers songs into my window
In words that nobody knows
Theres pretty girls on every corner
They watch him as hes walking home
Saying Does he know
Will you ever know

Youre beautiful every little piece love
Dont you know youre really gonna be someone
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life leads you back to my door
Oh but if it dont
Stay beautiful
Cory finds another way to be
The highlight of my day
Im taking pictures in my mind
So I can save em for a rainy day
Its hard to make a conversation
When hes taking my breath away
I should say Hey by the way

Youre beautiful every little piece love
Dont you know youre really gonna be someone
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life leads you back to my door
Oh but if it dont
Stay beautiful

If you and I are a story
That never gets told
If what you are is a daydream
Ill never get to hold at least youll know

Youre beautiful every little piece love
Dont you know youre really gonna be someone
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life leads you back to my front door
Oh but if it dont
Will you stay beautiful beautiful beautiful
Beautiful beautiful beautiful
La-la-la
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh but if it dont
Stay beautiful stay beautiful
Its strange to think the songs we used to sing
The smiles the flowers everything is gone
Yesterday I found out about you
Even now just lookin at you feels wrong

You say that youd take it all back
Given one chance
It was a moment of weakness
And you said yes
You shouldve said no you shouldve gone home
You shouldve thought twice fore you let it all go
You shouldve known that word
Bout what you did with herd get back to me Get back to me
And I shouldve been there in the back of your mind
I shouldnt be asking myself why
You shouldnt be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You shouldve said no
Baby and you might still have me

You can see that Ive been cryin
And baby you know all the right things to say
But do you honestly expect me to believe
We could ever be the same

You say that the past is the past
You need one chance
It was a moment of weakness
And you said yes

You shouldve said no you shouldve gone home
You shouldve thought twice fore you let it all go
You shouldve known that word
Bout what you did with her’d get back to me Get back to me
And I shouldve been there in the back of your mind
I shouldnt be asking myself why
You shouldnt be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You shouldve said no
Baby and you might still have me
Oh oh
I cant resist
Before you go tell me this
Was it worth it
Was she worth this
No no
No no no no

You shouldve said no you shouldve gone home
You shouldve thought twice fore you let it all go
You shouldve known that word
Bout what you did with her’d get back to me Get back to me
And I shouldve been there in the back of your mind
I shouldnt be asking myself why
You shouldnt be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You shouldve said no
She said I was seven and you were nine
I looked at you like the stars that shined
In the sky the pretty lights
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
Growing up and falling in love
And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes
And said Oh my my my

Take me back to the house in the backyard tree
Said youd beat me up you were bigger than me
You never did you never did
Take me back when our world was one block wide
I dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried
Just two kids you and I
Oh my my my my
Well I was sixteen when suddenly
I wasnt that little girl you used to see
But your eyes still shined like pretty lights
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
They never believed wed really fall in love
And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes
And said Oh my my my

Take me back to the creek beds we turned up
2 am riding in your truck
And all I need is you next to me
Take me back to the time we had our very first fight
The slamming of doors stead of kissing goodnight
You stayed outside til the morning light
Oh my my my my

A few years had gone and come around
We were sitting at our favorite spot in town
And you looked at me got down on one knee

Take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle
Our whole town came and our mamas cried
You said I do and I did too
Take me home where we met so many years before
Well rock our babies on that very front porch
After all this time you and I
And Ill be eighty-seven youll be eighty-nine
Ill still look at you like the stars that shine
I was ridin shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
Hes got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around turn the radio down
He says Baby is something wrong
I say Nothin I was just thinkin
How we dont have a song
And he says
Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin out late tapping on your window
When were on the phone and you talk real slow
Cause its late and your mama dont know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date Man I didnt kiss her and I should have
And when I got home fore I said amen
Askin God if he could play it again

I was walking up the front porch steps
After everything that day
Had gone all wrong or been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway well on my way
To my lovin bed
I almost didnt notice all the roses
And the note that said

Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin out late tapping on your window
When were on the phone and you talk real slow
Cause its late and your mama dont know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date Man I didnt kiss her and I should have
And when I got home fore I said amen
Askin God if he could play it again
Da-da-da-da

Ive heard every album listened to the radio
Waited for somethin to come along
That was as good as our song

Cause our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin out late tappin on his window
When were on the phone and he talks real slow
Cause its late and his mama dont know
Our song is the way he laughs
The first date Man I didnt kiss him and I should have
And when I got home fore I said amen
Askin God if he could play it again

Play it again oh yeah
Oh oh yeah

I was ridin shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
I grabbed a pen and an old napkin
Friday night beneath the stars
In a field behind your yard
You and I are painting pictures in the sky
And sometimes we dont say a thing
Just listen to the crickets sing
Everything I need is right here by my side

And I know everything about you
I dont wanna live without you
Im only up when youre not down
Dont wanna fly if youre still on the ground
Its like no matter what I do
Well you drive me crazy half the time
The other half Im only tryin to
Let you know that what I feel is true
And Im only me when Im with you

Just a small-town boy and girl
Livin in a crazy world
Tryna figure out what is and isnt true
And I dont try to hide my tears
My secrets or my deepest fears
Through it all nobody gets me like you do

And you know everything about me
You say that you cant live without me

Im only up when youre not down
Dont wanna fly if youre still on the ground
Its like no matter what I do
Well you drive me crazy half the time
The other half Im only tryin to
Let you know that what I feel is true
And Im only me when Im with you
When Im with anybody else
Its so hard to be myself
And only you can tell

That Im only up when youre not down
Dont wanna fly if youre still on the ground
Its like no matter what I do
Well you drive me crazy half the time
The other half Im only tryin to
Let you know that what I feel is true
And Im only me
Who I wanna be
Well Im only me when Im with you

With you
She cant see the way your eyes
Light up when you smile
Shell never notice how you stop and stare
Whenever she walks by

And you cant see me wanting you the way you want her
But you are everything to me

And I just wanna show you
She dont even know you
Shes never gonna love you like I want to
And you just see right through me
But if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful miracle unbelievable
Instead of just invisible
Oh yeah oh

Theres a fire inside of you
That cant help but shine through
Shes never gonna see the light
No matter what you do

And all I think about is how to make you think of me
And everything that we could be

And I just wanna show you
She dont even know you
Shes never gonna love you like I want to
And you just see right through me
But if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful miracle unbelievable
Instead of just invisible

Like shadows in a faded light
Oh were invisible
I just wanna open your eyes
And make you realize
I just wanna show you
She dont even know you
Baby let me love you let me want you
You just see right through me
But if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful miracle unbelievable
Instead of just invisible

Oh yeah

She cant see the way your eyes
Why would you wanna break
A perfectly good heart
Why would you wanna take
Our love and tear it all apart now
Why would you wanna make
The very first scar
Why would you wanna break
A perfectly good heart

Maybe I shouldve seen the signs
Shouldve read the writing on the wall
And realized by the distance in your eyes
That I would be the one to fall
No matter what you say
I still cant believe that you would walk away
It dont make sense to me but

Why would you wanna break
A perfectly good heart
Why would you wanna take
Our love and tear it all apart now
Why would you wanna make
The very first scar
Why would you wanna break
A perfectly good heart

Its not unbroken anymore Its not unbroken anymore
How do I get it back the way it was before

Why would you wanna break
A perfectly good heart
Why would you wanna take
Our love and tear it all apart now
Why would you wanna make
The very first scar
Why would you wanna break—
Why Would you wanna break it
Why would you wanna break
A perfectly good heart
Why would you wanna take
Our love and tear it all apart now
Why would you wanna make
The very first scar
Why would you wanna break
A perfectly good heart

Hey a little bit ago we were talking about uh songwriting and listening to songs and putting down what you feel in the song and um up next in the countdown is Taylor Swift and have you heard this song yet

I have heard this song

Tim McGraw And what what did you think the first time you heard it Or how was the first time

It was awesome Uh except for I didnt know if I should I should take it as a compliment or I should feel old
Ah ha ha ha

I didnt know which one but the more the more I hear it the more I dont know if its true or not but I start taking it as a compliment and not that I feel that Im old I dont know if thats true but thats what I choose to think

Why dont we find out Taylor is a compliment or uh hes old

Oh its definitely a compliment Yeah Laughing

Tim McGraw meet Taylor Swift

Nice-

Nice to meet you

Nice to meet you Taylor How you doing

Im doing great How are you doing
Im doing good Congratulations on your record Its doing great

Thank you so much Im just so excited Thank you for uh having good music and everything I swear Im not a stalker Laughing

Well-

The funny thing about this song is ya know as a writer some of the songs that you write like four hours youll do them writing a song and itll be good and everything but I wrote this one in literally 15 minutes And ya know I really didnt think anything about calling in Tim McGraw so I kinda shelved it for like three months and never even thought that it was going to be a single But um my label heard it and was like were putting that outLaughing

Well Im glad ya did cause um its doing well for ya

So I- so I understand that you two guys have not talked

No

You havent met

No
No weve never talked or met or anything

I sent her a message one time I think with Entertainment Weekly
Or something like that Oh I dont remember what show it was I was doing an interview and they were going to interview Taylor the next day So I sent her a little message so I dont know if she got it or not

Oh my God They never gave that to me

They didnt Okay well there ya go I did Laughing

So I-I

Weve just officially never never talked or messaged or anything

Not at all

So I thought I think its pretty brave to put out a song called Tim McGraw without maybe talking to Tim McGraw Did you mind

It was definitely kind of a chance Ya know I didnt say anything bad in the song so I was kinda thinking ya know he wouldnt take it too bad

Well thank you for that Thank you for not saying anything bad
Im sure theres plenty that couldve been said Tell me-

Could you tell Faith that I said hello

I sure will I sure will And she loves the song too by the way

Oh my gosh shes awesome

I agree

This thisTell me about writing a song Um did this did this really happen

Well yeah I mean I never really kinda went into this writing
Session on Im gonna write a song called Tim McGraw
Um yeah because that would just be weird But um Laughing
I actually this this is kinda strange but I actually came up with the
melody and ideas for this song in math class in my freshman year
of high school

Now I feel old

And um I was sitting there and was kind of started singing it to myself And I was going through a period where I was dating this guy that was going off to college and I knew we were gonna break up So I started to think about all the things that I knew would remind him of me And its kinda like a given one of all my friends ya know That my favorite songs are Tim McGraw songs They just are

Aww thank you

And uh you know so I kinda just thought about that first And so it pointed to the song and just sat down at that piano And wrote it with this co-writer who was kinda wondering if I was crazy or not but it turned out alright And ya know the funny thing is that I shelved this song for like three months and never never even played it for anybody never even demoed it And uh then one time I was just goofing around and played it for my record label president and he goes Well thats your first single Laughing

And Im like well

Well you can write songs about me anytime Taylor Laughing

Thats awesome Theres a part two coming out next month
