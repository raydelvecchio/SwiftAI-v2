Please tell me\n'Cause one second it was perfect\nNow you're halfway out the door\nAnd I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called\nAnd then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all\nAnd you flashback to when he said, \"Forever and always\"\nOh, and it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong\nIt rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone\nI was there when you said, \"Forever and always\"\n\nWas I out of line?\nDid I say something way too honest made you run and hide?\nLike a scared little boy\nI looked into your eyes\nThought I knew you for a minute now I'm not so sure\nSo here's to everything coming down to nothing\nHere's to silence that cuts me to the core\nWhere is this going?\nThought I knew for a minute but I don't anymore\n\nAnd I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called\nAnd then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all\nAnd you flashback to when he said, \"Forever and always\"\nAnd it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong\nIt rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone\nI was there when you said, \"Forever and always\"\nSee Taylor Swift LiveGet tickets as low as $307You might also like\nYou didn't mean it, baby\nI don't think so\n\nOh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh\nOh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh\nBack up, baby, back up\nDid you forget everything?\nBack up, baby, back up\nDid you forget everything?\nBack up, baby, back up\nPlease back up, oh back up\nBack up, baby, back up\n\n'Cause it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong\nIt rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone\nI was there when you said, \"Forever and always\"\nAnd I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called\nAnd then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all\nAnd you flashback to when we said, \"Forever and always\"\n'Cause it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong\nIt rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone\nI was there when you said, \"Forever and always\"\nYou didn't mean it baby\nYou said, \"Forever and always\", yeah5Embed"

I don't know what to think\"\nHe knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said\n\n\"Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone\nI love you, and that's all I really know\nI talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress\nIt's a love story, baby, just say 'Yes'\"\n\nOh, oh, oh\nOh, oh, oh\n'Cause we were both young when I first saw you177Embed"
