(Huh)\nI can reclaim the land\nAnd I miss you (Miss you)\nBut I miss sparklin' (Nice)\n\nBest believe I'm still bejeweled\nWhen I walk in the room\nI can still make the whole place shimmer\nAnd when I meet the band\nThey ask, \"Do you have a man?\"\nI could still say, \"I don't remember\"\nFamiliarity breeds contempt\nDon't put me in the basement\nWhen I want the penthouse of your heart\nDiamonds in my eyes\nI polish up real, I polish up real nice\n\nNice\nSee Taylor Swift LiveGet tickets as low as $307You might also like\nSapphire tears on my face\nSadness became my whole sky\nBut some guy said my aura's moonstone\nJust 'cause he was high\nAnd we're dancin' all night\nAnd you can try to change my mind\nBut you might have to wait in line\nWhat's a girl gonna do?\nA diamond's gotta shine\n\nBest believe I'm still bejeweled\nWhen I walk in the room\nI can still make the whole place shimmer (Shimmer)\nAnd when I meet the band\nThey ask, \"Do you have a man?\"\nI could still say, \"I don't remember\"\nFamiliarity breeds contempt\nDon't put me in the basement\nWhen I want the penthouse of your heart\nDiamonds in my eyes\nI polish up real (Nice), I polish up real nice\n\nAnd we're dancin' all night\nAnd you can try to change my mind\nBut you might have to wait in line\nWhat's a girl gonna do?
