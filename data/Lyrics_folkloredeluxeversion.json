Would you want me?\nWould you tell me to go fuck myself\nOr lead me to the garden?\nIn the garden, would you trust me\nIf I told you it was just a summer thing?\nI'm only seventeen, I don't know anything\nBut I know I miss you\n\nBetty, I know where it all went wrong\nYour favorite song was playing\nFrom the far side of the gym\nI was nowhere to be found\nI hate the crowds, you know that\nPlus, I saw you dance with him\n\nYou heard the rumors from Inez\nYou can't believe a word she says\nMost times, but this time it was true\nThe worst thing that I ever did\nWas what I did to you\n\nBut if I just showed up at your party\nWould you have me? Would you want me?\nWould you tell me to go fuck myself\nOr lead me to the garden?\nIn the garden, would you trust me\nIf I told you it was just a summer thing?\nI'm only seventeen, I don't know anything\nBut I know I miss you\nSee Taylor Swift LiveGet tickets as low as $307You might also like\nI was walking home on broken cobblestones\nJust thinking of you when she pulled up like\nA figment of my worst intentions\nShe said \"James, get in, let's drive\"\nThose days turned into nights\nSlept next to her, but\nI dreamt of you all summer long\n\nBetty, I'm here on your doorstep\nAnd I planned it out for weeks now\nBut it's finally sinkin' in\nBetty, right now is the last time\nI can dream about what happens when\nYou see my face again\n\nThe only thing I wanna do\nIs make it up to you\nSo I showed up at your party\nYeah, I showed up at your party\n\nYeah, I showed up at your party\nWill you have me? Will you love me?\nWill you kiss me on the porch\nIn front of all your stupid friends?\nIf you kiss me, will it be just like I dreamed it?\nWill it patch your broken wings?\nI'm only seventeen, I don't know anything\nBut I know I miss you\nStanding in your cardigan\nKissin' in my car again\nStopped at a streetlight\nYou know I miss you93Embed"

    "lyrics": "\u200bfolklore  LyricsIt started with imagery. Visuals that popped into my mind and piqued my curiosity.\nStars drawn around scars. A cardigan that still bears the scent of loss twenty years later. Battleships sinking into the ocean, down, down, down. The tree swing in the woods of my childhood. Hushed tones of \"let's run away\" and never doing it. The sun drenched month of August, sipped away like a bottle of wine. A mirrored disco ball hovering above a dance floor. A whiskey bottle beckoning. Hands held through plastic. A single thread that, for better or for worse, ties you to your fate.\nPretty soon these images in my head grew faces or names and became characters. I found myself not only writing my own stories, but also writing about or from the perspective of people I've never met, people I've known, or those I wish I hadn't. An exiled man walking the bluffs of a land that isn't his own, wondering how it all went so terribly, terribly wrong. An embittered tormentor showing up at the funeral of his fallen object of obsession. A seventeen-year-old standing on a porch, learning to apologize. Lovestruck kids wandering up and down the evergreen High Line. My grandfather, Dean, landing at Guadalcanal in 1942. A misfit widow getting gleeful revenge on the town that cast her out.\nA tale that becomes folklore is one that is passed down and whispered around. Sometimes even sung about. The lines between fantasy and reality blur and the boundaries between truth and diction become almost indiscernible. Speculation, over time, becomes fact. Myths, ghost stories, and fables. Fairytales and parables. Gossip and legend. Someone's secrets written in the sky for all to behold.\nIn isolation my imagination has run wild and this album is the result, a collection of songs and stories that flowed like a stream of consciousness. Picking up a pen was my way of escaping into fantasy, history, and memory. I've told these stories to the best of my ability with all the love, wonder, and whimsy they deserve.\nNow it's up to you to pass them down.See Taylor Swift LiveGet tickets as low as $307Embed"
